Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": ["5mm", "10mm", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA"],
  "3. Gleason score": ["4+4=8", "4+3=7", "3+4=7", "NA", "NA", "NA"],
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "kyllä"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 2, the sizes are only mentioned for samples 1 and 2, so the rest are marked as "NA" (not available).
* For question 3, the Gleason scores are only mentioned for samples 1, 2, and 3, so the rest are marked as "NA".
* For question 4, BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not explicitly mentioned in the text, but hyperplastic changes are mentioned in the last sentence, which might be related to BPH. However, to be conservative, I marked it as "ei" (no).
* For question 5, perineural growth is not mentioned at all in the text, so I marked it as "NA".
* For question 6, atypia is mentioned in the first sentence as "huonosti erilaistunutta atyyppista rauhasrakennetta", which translates to "poorly differentiated atypical glandular structure", so I marked it as "kyllä" (yes).
