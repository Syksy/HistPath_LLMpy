Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": ["8 (4+4)", "7 (4+3)", "7 (3+4)", "NA", "NA", "NA"],
  "4. BPH detection": "kyll채",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "kyll채"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 2, the size of the samples is not explicitly mentioned, so I answered "NA" (Not Available).
* For question 3, I listed the Gleason scores for each colony separately, as they are different. For the remaining samples, I answered "NA" since no Gleason score was mentioned.
* For question 4, I answered "kyll채" (yes) because the text mentions "hyperplastic changes in the epithelium", which is a characteristic of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia).
* For question 5, I answered "ei" (no) because perineural growth is not mentioned in the text.
* For question 6, I answered "kyll채" (yes) because the text mentions "atypical glandular structure" and "atypia" is a characteristic of cancerous cells.
