Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "120mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 6, because the report mentions "6 representative prostate biopsies".
* "sample_size_or_weight": "120mm", because the report mentions "approx. 120mm in total".
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention a Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA, because the report mentions "Suspicio finding on biopsies" which suggests that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": NA, because the report does not mention atypia explicitly, although it mentions "basal cell hyperplasia" which could be related to atypia.
