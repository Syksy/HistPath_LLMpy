Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4+6+3 mm, 5+7+8 mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient is 6 (4+6+3 from the left and 5+7+8 from the right).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size of the samples is given in millimeters (4+6+3 mm and 5+7+8 mm).
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so it is marked as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: There is no clear indication of whether the sample shows only benign hyperplasia or not, so it is marked as NA.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so it is marked as NA.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so it is marked as NA.
