Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": "(12)",
  "2. Size of the samples": "(8mm, 7mm, 5mm)",
  "3. Gleason score": "(3+3=6/6/NA)",
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": "(ei)",
  "5. Perineural invasion": "(ei)",
  "6. Nuclear atypia": "(ei)"
}
```

Let me explain each answer:

1. The number of samples taken is 12, as mentioned in the last sentence of the report.
2. The sizes of the samples are 8mm, 7mm, and 5mm, as mentioned in the report.
3. The Gleason score is 3+3=6, which is a type 3+3 adenocarcinoma.
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. The report explicitly states that "No nuclear atypia is observed", so the answer is "ei" (no).
