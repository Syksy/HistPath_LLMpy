Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient. In this case, it's a single sample (höyläyslastu).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample. In this case, it's 4 grams.
* `Gleason_score`: Since there is no mention of Gleason score in the report, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Based on the report, it seems that the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (prostatahyperplasia), so I've marked this as true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've marked this as false.
* `atypia`: Similarly, there is no mention of atypia in the report, so I've marked this as false.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more reports!
