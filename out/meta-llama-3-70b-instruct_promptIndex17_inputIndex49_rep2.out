Here are the answers in JSON format:

{
"1. How many samples have been taken?": "NA",
"2. What is the size of the samples taken?": "12.3g",
"3. What is the Gleason score of the samples?": "NA",
"4. Can BPH be detected in the samples taken?": "Epäsuorasti, koska stromal hyperplasia viittaa mahdolliseen BPH:hen",
"5. Can perineural growth be detected in the samples taken?": "NA",
"6. Can atypia be detected in the samples taken?": "NA"
}

Note: For question 4, I answered "Epäsuorasti, koska stromal hyperplasia viittaa mahdolliseen BPH:hen", which means "Indirectly, as stromal hyperplasia suggests possible BPH". This is because the text mentions stromal hyperplasia, which can be a sign of BPH, but it's not a direct confirmation.
