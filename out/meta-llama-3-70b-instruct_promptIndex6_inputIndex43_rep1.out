Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "19g",
  "Gleason_score": "5+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Since the report doesn't explicitly state the number of samples, I assumed it's 1, as it's a single report.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions "About 19g of prostate shavings in total", so I extracted this value.
* `Gleason_score`: The report states "the highest level 5 and the second highest level 4 in the Gleason classification", which corresponds to a Gleason score of 5+4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions "a carpet-like malignant growth", which indicates that it's not just benign hyperplasia, so I set this to `false`.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I set this to `false`.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I set this to `false`.
