Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 9,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7/7/NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions samples A-C (3 samples), two macrosections per base D-E (4 samples), F-G base (2 samples), and H-I two samples from seminal vesicles (2 samples), making a total of 9 samples.
2. The size of the samples is not mentioned in the text, so it's NA (not available).
3. The Gleason score is mentioned as Gleason grade 3 and grade 4 differentiation being almost equal, so the major grade is 3 and the minor grade is 4, making the sum 7.
4. There is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) in the text, so it's "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so it's NA (not available).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so it's NA (not available).
