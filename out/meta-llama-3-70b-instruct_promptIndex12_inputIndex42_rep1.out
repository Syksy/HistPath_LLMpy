Here are the answers to each question in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": 12,
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "3+4=7",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples is 12, as stated in the report: "The shavings obtained from planing were cut into 12 tissue blocks."
2. There is no mention of the size of the samples, so the answer is "NA".
3. The Gleason score is 7, with a major component of 3 and a minor component of 4, as stated in the report: "In the portion that can be interpreted as neoplastic, Gleason sum is 7, of which the larger portion is class 3, about 60% of the tumor."
4. The report does not mention benign prostatic hyperplasia, and the carcinoma is described as a small part of the chips, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth, so the answer is "NA".
6. There is no mention of atypia, so the answer is "NA".
