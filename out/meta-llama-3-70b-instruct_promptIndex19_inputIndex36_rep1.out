Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 16,
  "2. Size of samples": NA,
  "3. Gleason score": 3+4=7/7/NA,
  "4. BPH detection": NA,
  "5. Perineural growth detection": NA,
  "6. Atypia detection": NA
}
```

Explanation:

1. The number of samples is 16, as there are 4 specimens (D-G, K-P, O-Q) with 4 samples each.
2. The size of the samples is not mentioned in the text, so it's NA (not available).
3. The Gleason score is 7, with a major score of 3 and a minor score of 4, making it 3+4=7.
4. There is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) in the text, so it's NA.
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so it's NA.
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so it's NA.
