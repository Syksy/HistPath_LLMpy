Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions that 20g of tissue was divided into 6 blocks, so I assume this means there are 6 samples.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total weight of the tissue is 30g.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I return NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report concludes that the finding is consistent with benign hyperplasia, so I return true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I return false.
* `atypia`: The report explicitly states that there is no atypia, so I return false.
