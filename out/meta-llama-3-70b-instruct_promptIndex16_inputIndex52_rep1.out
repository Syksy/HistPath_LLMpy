Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("9"),
  "2. Size of the samples taken": ("macrosections"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("3+4=7/7/NA"),
  "4. Presence of benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("ei"),
  "5. Presence of perineural growth": ("ei"),
  "6. Presence of atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples taken is 9, which includes 2 macrosections from the apex (A-C), 2 macrosections from the base (D-E), 2 macrosections from the base (F-G), and 2 samples from the seminal vesicles (H-I).
2. The size of the samples taken is macrosections, which is a type of large tissue section.
3. The Gleason score is 3+4=7, which indicates that the tumor has a Gleason grade 3 and grade 4 differentiation, with the prevailing grade being almost equal.
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
