Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 9,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The text mentions multiple samples taken from different regions, including apex (A-C), base (D-E, F-G), and seminal vesicles (H-I). There are a total of 9 samples mentioned.
2. The size of the samples is not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I've marked it as "NA" (not available).
3. The text mentions that the prevailing Gleason grade is 3 and grade 4 differentiation, which is almost equal. This suggests a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
4. There is no mention of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the text, so I've marked it as "NA".
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so I've marked it as "NA".
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so I've marked it as "NA".
