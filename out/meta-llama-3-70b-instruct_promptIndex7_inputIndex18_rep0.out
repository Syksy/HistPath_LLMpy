Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4+6+3 mm (left) and 5+7+8 mm (right)",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions 4+6+3 samples from the left and 5+7+8 samples from the right, so the total number of samples is 6.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report provides the size of the samples in millimeters.
* `Gleason_score`: The report does not mention the Gleason score, so it is marked as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions malignant growth and positive margins, so it is clear that it is not a case of benign hyperplasia only. Therefore, the answer is false.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These are not mentioned in the report, so they are marked as NA.
