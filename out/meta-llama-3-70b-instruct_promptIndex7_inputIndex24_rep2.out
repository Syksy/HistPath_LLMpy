Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": NA, because the report does not mention the number of samples taken from the patient.
* "sample_size_or_weight": NA, because the report does not provide information about the size or weight of the samples.
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention the Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": true, because the report states that the finding is benign and shows mainly regular prostate tissue.
* "perineural_invasion": false, because there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* "atypia": false, because there is no mention of atypia or abnormal changes in the report.
