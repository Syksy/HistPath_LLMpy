Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("4"),
  "2. Size of the samples": ("10 mm, 7 mm, 15 mm, 10 mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("3+4=7"),
  "4. Is there benign prostatic hyperplasia?": ("ei"),
  "5. Is there perineural growth?": ("kyllä"),
  "6. Is there atypia?": ("NA")
}
```

Note: 

* For question 4, I assumed "hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvua" means benign prostatic hyperplasia, and since the report doesn't mention it, I answered "ei".
* For question 6, I answered "NA" since the report doesn't mention atypia.
