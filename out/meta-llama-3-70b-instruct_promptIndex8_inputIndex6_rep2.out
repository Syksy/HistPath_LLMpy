Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": "multiple",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": "7 (3+4)",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The report mentions multiple samples (D-G apex, basis, and seminaalivehikkeleit√§), so I've entered "multiple" as the value.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: There is no mention of the size or weight of the samples, so I've entered "NA" (not available).
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions a Gleason score of 7, with a major component of 3 and a minor component of 4 (although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred from the text).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions a tumor, so it's not a case of benign hyperplasia only, hence "ei" (no).
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion, so I've entered "ei" (no).
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia, so I've entered "ei" (no).
