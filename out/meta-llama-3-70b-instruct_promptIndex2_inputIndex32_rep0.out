Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("3"),
  "2. Size of the samples": ("90mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("NA"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("kyllä"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("NA"),
  "6. Atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Let me explain the answers:

1. The patient has 3 prostatic core needle biopsies.
2. The total length of the samples is 90mm.
3. There is no Gleason score mentioned in the report, so the answer is "NA".
4. The report mentions "glandular structures, which would perhaps indicate hyperplasia", so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is "NA".
6. The report explicitly states "no atypia or findings suggestive of malignancy", so the answer is "ei" (no).
