Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain enough information to answer the questions. The text appears to be a summary of a patient's medical history and a plan for further action, but it does not provide specific details about the biopsy samples.

Here are the answers in JSON format, with "NA" indicating that the information is not available:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "NA",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "NA",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "NA"
}
```

If you have access to the actual biopsy report or more detailed information, I would be happy to help you extract the relevant information.
