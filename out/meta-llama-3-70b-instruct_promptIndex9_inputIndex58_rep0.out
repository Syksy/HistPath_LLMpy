Here are the answers to the questions based on the provided histopathological report:

{
"(Näytteiden määrä)": 6,
"(Näytteiden koko)": "NA",
"(Gleason-luokitus)": 7,
"(Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu)": "ei",
"(Perineuraalinen kasvu)": "NA",
"(Atypia)": "NA"
}

Note: 

* For question 2, the report does not provide a clear answer, so I responded with "NA".
* For question 4, the report mentions Gleason 5 growth patterns, but mainly poorly differentiated Gleason 4+3=7 growth, which suggests that the growth is not well-differentiated, so I responded with "ei".
* For questions 5 and 6, the report does not provide a clear answer, so I responded with "NA".
