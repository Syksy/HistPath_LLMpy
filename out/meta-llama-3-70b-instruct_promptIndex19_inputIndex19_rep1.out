Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "12.3g",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyll채",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions "N채ytteen채 on yhteens채..." which means "The sample is..." implying that only one sample has been taken.
2. The size of the sample is 12.3g as mentioned in the text.
3. There is no mention of Gleason score in the text, so it's NA (not available).
4. The text mentions "strooman hyperplasiasta" which is a Finnish term for stromal hyperplasia, which is a characteristic feature of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). So, BPH can be detected in the samples taken.
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so it's "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so it's "ei" (no).
