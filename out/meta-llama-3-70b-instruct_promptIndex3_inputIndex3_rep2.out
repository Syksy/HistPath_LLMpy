Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 2,
  "2. Size of samples": "60mm (right), 80mm (left)",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+5=9",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "no"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 4, I answered 'NA' because there is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) in the text.
* For question 5, I answered 'NA' because there is no mention of perineural growth in the text.
* For question 6, I answered 'no' because the text mentions that there is no atypia detected in the samples taken.
