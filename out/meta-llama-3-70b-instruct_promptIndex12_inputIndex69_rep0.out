I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text does not appear to be a histopathological report, but rather a passage from a science fiction novel. It does not contain any relevant information about a patient's biopsy samples.

As a result, I will have to respond with "NA" (Not Available) for all the requested information. Here is the response in JSON format:

```
{
  "Näytteiden määrä": "NA",
  "Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "NA",
  "Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "Atypia": "NA"
}
```

If you could provide an actual histopathological report, I would be happy to assist you in extracting the relevant information.
