Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("NA"),
  "2. Size of the samples": ("100mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("NA"),
  "4. Presence of benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("ei"),
  "5. Presence of perineural growth": ("kyll√§"),
  "6. Presence of atypia": ("NA")
}
```

Note: 

* For question 1, the number of samples taken is not explicitly mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as "NA" (not available).
* For question 3, the Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as "NA".
* For question 4, there is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia, so I've marked it as "ei" (no).
* For question 6, there is no mention of atypia, so I've marked it as "NA".
