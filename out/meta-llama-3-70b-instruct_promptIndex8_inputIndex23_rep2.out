Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"sample": 1, "size": "8+6mm"},
    {"sample": 2, "size": "10mm"},
    {"sample": 3, "size": "5+5mm"}
  ],
  "gleason_score": [
    {"sample": 1, "score": "3+4=7"},
    {"sample": 2, "score": "3+4=7"},
    {"sample": 3, "score": NA}
  ],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "kyll√§"
}
```

Note: I assumed that the presence of PIN-muutoksia (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) in samples 1 and 2 indicates atypia. If this is not the case, please let me know and I'll correct the report.
