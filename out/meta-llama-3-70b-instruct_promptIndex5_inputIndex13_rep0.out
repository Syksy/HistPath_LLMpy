Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "19g",
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary": 5,
    "secondary": 4
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Since the report doesn't explicitly state the number of samples, I assumed it's a single sample (the prostate tissue).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions the weight of the sample as approximately 19g.
* `Gleason_score`: The report provides a Gleason score with primary and secondary components, which are levels 5 and 4, respectively.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions "mattomaista pahanlaatuista kasvua" which translates to "abundant malignant growth", indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report mentions "pahanlaatuista kasvua stroomassa" which suggests perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I returned NA (Not Available) for this field.
