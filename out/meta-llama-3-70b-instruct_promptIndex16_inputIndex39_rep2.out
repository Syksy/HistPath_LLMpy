Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "8",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "13g",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "3+3=6",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu": "kyllä",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "ei",
  "6. Atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples taken is 8, as indicated by the phrase "eight cassettes".
2. The size of the samples is 13g, as stated in the report.
3. The Gleason score is 3+3=6, which is a measure of the aggressiveness of the cancer.
4. Since the report mentions "carcinoma" and provides a Gleason score, it can be inferred that there is malignant growth present, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
