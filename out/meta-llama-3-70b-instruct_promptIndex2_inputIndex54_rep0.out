Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": ("8"),
  "2. Näytteiden koko": ("NA"),
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": ("NA"),
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": ("kyllä"),
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 8, as stated in the report.
* The size of the samples is not mentioned in the report, so I marked it as "NA" (not available).
* There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I marked it as "NA".
* The report states that the finding is benign, which implies that there is no malignant growth, so I answered "kyllä" (yes) to question 4.
* There is no mention of perineural growth or atypia in the report, so I answered "ei" (no) to questions 5 and 6.
