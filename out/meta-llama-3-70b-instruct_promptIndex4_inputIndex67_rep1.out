I'll do my best to extract the relevant information from the given text and provide a structured response in JSON format.

Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

The reason for all the `NA` values is that the provided text does not contain any specific information about a patient's biopsy or pathology report. The text appears to be a general information article about prostate cancer, its diagnosis, and staging. It does not provide any specific data about a patient's samples, Gleason score, or other relevant details.
