Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "8mm and 5mm",
  "Gleason_score": "4+4 and 3+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "NA",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 6, because the report mentions that six macroblocks were made from the prostatectomy resection.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "8mm and 5mm", because the report mentions the size of the malignant foci in the apex and base.
* "Gleason_score": "4+4 and 3+4", because the report mentions the Gleason scores for the apex and base.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": "NA", because the report does not mention that the sample only shows benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": "NA", because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": "NA", because the report does not mention atypia.
