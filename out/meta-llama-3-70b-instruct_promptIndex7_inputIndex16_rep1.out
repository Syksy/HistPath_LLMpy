Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": "4+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions that six macroblocks were made from the prostatectomy resection, so I assume this is the number of samples.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: There is no information about the size or weight of the samples, so I return NA.
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions a Gleason score of 4+4 for the apex and 3+4 for the base, but I will return only one value. If you want to return both values, we can discuss how to represent them.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor, so this is set to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I return NA.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I return NA.
