Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["4mm", "6mm", "3mm", "5mm", "7mm", "8mm"],
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of samples taken from the patient is 6 (4+6+3 from the left and 5+7+8 from the right).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the samples are listed as an array of strings, since the units are not specified.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so it is marked as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions malignant growth, so this field is set to false.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These features are not mentioned in the report, so they are marked as NA.
