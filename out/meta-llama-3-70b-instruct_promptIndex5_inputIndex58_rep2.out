Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "Biopsian√§ytteet",
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": {
    "pattern": "4+3",
    "total": 7
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_type`: The type of sample, which in this case is a biopsy.
* `number_of_samples`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the samples, which is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (not available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the sample, which is a combination of two patterns (4 and 3) with a total score of 7.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, it's false because Gleason patterns are present.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are marked as NA because there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the report.
