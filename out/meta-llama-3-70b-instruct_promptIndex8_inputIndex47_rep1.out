Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "10 mm, 7 mm, 15 mm, 10 mm",
  "Gleason_score": "3+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "kyll채",
  "atypia": "kyll채"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: 4, since there are 4 fragments mentioned (2 from the left side and 2 from the right side).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the fragments are listed in millimeters.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as 3+4, which is the sum of the main rule (Gleason type 3) and the second most common type (Gleason type 4).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei" (no), since the report mentions carcinoma cells and perineural invasion.
* `perineural_invasion`: "kyll채" (yes), since the report mentions growth around nerves.
* `atypia`: "kyll채" (yes), since the report mentions low-differentiated carcinoma cells, which are atypical.
