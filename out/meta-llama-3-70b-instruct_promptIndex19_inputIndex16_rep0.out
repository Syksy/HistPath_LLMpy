Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+4=8/3+4=7/NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions "kuusi makroleikett√§" which means 6 macroscopic samples.
2. The size of the samples is not explicitly mentioned, so I answered "NA" (not available).
3. The Gleason score is mentioned as 4+4 in the apex and 3+4 in the base, so I answered accordingly.
4. There is no mention of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the text, so I answered "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so I answered "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so I answered "ei" (no).
