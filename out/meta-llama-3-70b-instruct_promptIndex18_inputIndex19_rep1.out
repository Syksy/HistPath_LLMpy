Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": "1",
  "2. Size of samples": "12.3g",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyll√§",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is assumed to be 1 since the text doesn't explicitly mention multiple samples.
* The size of the samples is 12.3g as mentioned in the text.
* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is likely detected since the text mentions "yleinen vaikutelma strooman hyperplasiasta" which translates to "a general impression of stromal hyperplasia".
* Perineural growth and atypia are not mentioned in the text, so they are marked as "ei" (no).
