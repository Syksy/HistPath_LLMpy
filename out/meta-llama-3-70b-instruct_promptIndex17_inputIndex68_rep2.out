I think there's been a mistake! The provided text is not a medical note written by a pathologist in Finnish, but rather a physics text about force, acceleration, and kinetic energy.

As a result, I won't be able to extract any information related to medical samples or diagnoses. Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. How many samples have been taken?": "NA",
  "2. What is the size of the samples taken?": "NA",
  "3. What is the Gleason score of the samples?": "NA",
  "4. Can BPH be detected in the samples taken?": "NA",
  "5. Can perineural growth be detected in the samples taken?": "NA",
  "6. Can atypia be detected in the samples taken?": "NA"
}
```

If you could provide the actual medical note in Finnish, I'd be happy to help you extract the information you need!
