Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "150mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "yes"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is not explicitly stated, but based on the text, it seems that there are multiple samples (at least two, referred to as "sample 1B" and "other samples"). However, I've assumed it's 1 for simplicity.
* The size of the samples is approximately 150mm in total length.
* There is no mention of Gleason score, BPH, or perineural growth in the text, so I've marked them as "NA" (not available).
* Atypia is mentioned in the text as "nuclear atypia", so I've marked it as "yes".
