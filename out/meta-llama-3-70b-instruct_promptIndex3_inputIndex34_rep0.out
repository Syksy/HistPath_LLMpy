Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "150mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "yes"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is not explicitly stated, but based on the text, it seems that there are multiple samples (at least 1B and others), so I assumed the answer is 1 (referring to sample 1B).
* The size of the samples is approximately 150mm.
* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is "NA".
* There is no mention of BPH or perineural growth in the text, so the answers are "NA".
* Atypia is mentioned in the text as "nuclear atypia", so the answer is "yes".
