Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("14"),
  "2. Size of the samples": ("macrosections"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("4+3=7"),
  "4. Is there benign prostatic hyperplasia?": ("ei"),
  "5. Is there perineural invasion?": ("kyllä"),
  "6. Is there atypia?": ("NA")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples taken is 14, as indicated by the labels A-N.
2. The size of the samples is described as macrosections, which means they are larger sections of tissue.
3. The Gleason score is 4+3=7, as the prevailing Gleason class is 4 and there is also some class 3.
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. Perineural invasion is abundantly observed, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
6. There is no mention of atypia, so the answer is "NA" (not applicable).
