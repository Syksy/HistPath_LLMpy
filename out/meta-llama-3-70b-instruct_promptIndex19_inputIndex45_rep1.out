Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyllä",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions "Samples 1-6", so there are 6 samples taken.
2. The size of the samples is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
3. The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
4. Although the text does not explicitly mention BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia), it does state that "benign prostate tissue is seen", which suggests that BPH can be detected, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. The text states that "no significant atypia is observed", so the answer is "ei" (no).
