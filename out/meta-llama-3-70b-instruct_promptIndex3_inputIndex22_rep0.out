Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 9,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions several samples taken, including apex näytteisiin A-C (3 samples), kaksi makroleikettä kohti basista D-E (2 samples), F-G basis (2 samples), and H-I kaksi näytettä seminaalivehikkeleistä (2 samples). In total, there are 9 samples.
2. The size of the samples is not explicitly mentioned in the text, so it's marked as "NA" (not available).
3. The Gleason score is mentioned as having a major class of 3 and a minor class of 4, with almost equal amounts of both. This corresponds to a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
4. There is no mention of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the text, so it's marked as "NA".
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so it's marked as "NA".
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so it's marked as "NA".
