Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 3,
  "2. Size of samples": "90mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. Can BPH be detected": "kyll√§",
  "5. Can perineural growth be detected": "ei",
  "6. Can atypia be detected": "ei"
}
```

Note: 

* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) can be detected, as the text mentions "hyperplasiaan" which is the Finnish term for hyperplasia.
* Perineural growth is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is "ei" (no).
* Atypia is not detected, as the text explicitly states "ei atypiaa".
