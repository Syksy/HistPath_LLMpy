Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30mm",
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions three fusion biopsies, so the answer is 3.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total length of the samples is 30mm, which is mentioned in the report.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is explicitly mentioned as 7 in the report.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since the report mentions carcinoma foci and Gleason score, it's clear that this is not a case of benign hyperplasia only, so the answer is false.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These features are not mentioned in the report, so I've marked them as NA (Not Available).
