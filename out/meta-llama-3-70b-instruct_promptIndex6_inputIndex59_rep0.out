Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30mm",
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions "Three fusion biopsies", so the answer is 3.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report states "From the total length of 30mm", so the answer is 30mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions "score 7", so the answer is 7.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions "carcinoma foci", which indicates that it's not just benign hyperplasia, so the answer is false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so the answer is NA (Not Available).
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is NA (Not Available).

Please note that I've assumed that the absence of information in the report means that the corresponding field should be marked as NA. If you have any further questions or clarifications, feel free to ask!
