Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 13,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "about 180mm of material",
  "Gleason_score": "3+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 13 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the samples, which is approximately 180mm of material.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is a combination of the primary and secondary patterns, which in this case is 3+4, indicating a primary pattern of 3 and a secondary pattern of 4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia. In this case, it's false because carcinoma was found in five biopsies.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field indicates whether perineural invasion (i.e., cancer cells invading the nerves) is present. Since it's not mentioned in the report, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `atypia`: This field indicates whether atypia (i.e., abnormal changes in the tissue) is present. Since it's not mentioned in the report, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
