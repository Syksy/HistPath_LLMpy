Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("D-G, K-P, O-Q", "Multiple samples, but exact number not specified"),
  "2. Size of the samples taken": ("Not specified", "NA"),
  "3. Gleason score of the samples": ("3+4=7", "7"),
  "4. Is there benign prostatic hyperplasia in the sample?": ("ei", "No"),
  "5. Is there perineural growth in the sample?": ("ei", "No"),
  "6. Is there atypia in the sample?": ("ei", "No")
}
```

Note: For question 1, I couldn't determine the exact number of samples taken, but it's clear that there are multiple samples (D-G, K-P, O-Q). For question 2, the size of the samples is not specified in the report.
