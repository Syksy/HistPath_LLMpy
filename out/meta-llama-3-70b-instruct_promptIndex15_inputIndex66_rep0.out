I apologize, but the provided text is a poem and does not contain any information about a histopathological report or a prostate cancer sample. It appears to be a personal and emotional reflection on loss and grief.

As a result, I cannot provide answers to the questions you've asked, as there is no relevant information in the text. If you could provide the actual histopathological report or a relevant text, I would be happy to help you extract the necessary information.

Here is the response in JSON format, indicating that the answers are not available (NA) due to the lack of relevant information:
