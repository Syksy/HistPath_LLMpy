Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "1",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "100mm",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "kyllä",
  "6. Atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The report mentions a "representative sample", implying that only one sample was taken from the patient.
2. The sample has a total length of 100mm.
3. There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so the answer is NA (not available).
4. The report does not mention any benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) findings, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. The report explicitly mentions "perineural growth", which is suspicious for malignancy, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
