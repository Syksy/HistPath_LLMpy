Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": "NA",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "19g",
  "Gleason_score": "5+4=9",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: Since the text doesn't explicitly mention the number of samples, I returned `NA`.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The text mentions the total weight of the prostate shavings as 19g.
* `Gleason_score`: The text mentions the highest level as 5 and the second highest level as 4, so I combined them into a single Gleason score.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since the text mentions a malignant growth, I returned `ei` (no).
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These were not mentioned in the text, so I returned `NA` for both.
