Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": "NA",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "19g",
  "Gleason_score": "5+4=9",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Since the report doesn't explicitly mention the number of samples, I've marked it as "NA".
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions "About 19g of prostate shavings in total", so I've used this value.
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions "the highest level 5 and the second highest level 4 in the Gleason classification", so I've combined them into a single score "5+4=9".
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since the report mentions "malignant growth", I've marked this as "ei" (no).
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These are not mentioned in the report, so I've marked them as "NA".
