Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": 3,
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "90mm",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "kyllä",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples is 3, as stated in the report.
2. The total length of the samples is 90mm, as stated in the report.
3. There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so the answer is "NA".
4. The report mentions "glandular structures, which would perhaps indicate hyperplasia", which suggests that there is benign prostatic hyperplasia, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is "NA".
6. The report explicitly states "no atypia or findings suggestive of malignancy", so the answer is "ei" (no).
