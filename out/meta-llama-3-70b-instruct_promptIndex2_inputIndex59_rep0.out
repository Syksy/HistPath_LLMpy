Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("3"),
  "2. Size of the samples": ("30mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("3+4=7"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("NA"),
  "6. Atypia": ("NA")
}
```

Note: 

* Question 4: There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
* Questions 5 and 6: There is no mention of perineural growth or atypia in the report, so the answers are "NA" (not available).
