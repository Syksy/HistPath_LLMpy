Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": "3+4=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the samples is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as "NA" (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is 3+4=7, which indicates the aggressiveness of the cancer.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field is set to `false` because the report mentions Gleason classes 3 and 4, which indicate cancerous growth.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field is set to `false` because the report explicitly states that there is no perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: This field is set to `false` because there is no mention of atypia in the report.
