Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "kyllä",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Since the report doesn't mention the exact number of samples taken, I've marked it as NA.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: There is no information about the size or weight of the samples, so I've marked it as NA.
* `Gleason_score`: The report doesn't provide any Gleason score information, so I've marked it as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report states that the finding is benign, which implies that only benign hyperplasia is present, so I've marked it as "kyllä" (yes).
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've marked it as "ei" (no).
* `atypia`: The report doesn't mention any atypical changes, so I've marked it as "ei" (no).
