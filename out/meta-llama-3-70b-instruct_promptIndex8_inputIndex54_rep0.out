Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": "kyllä",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Since the report doesn't mention the exact number of samples taken, I've marked it as NA.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: There is no information about the size or weight of the samples, so I've marked it as NA.
* `Gleason_score`: The report doesn't mention the Gleason score, so I've marked it as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia`: The report states that the finding is benign, which implies that the sample shows benign hyperplasia, so I've marked it as "kyllä" (yes).
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've marked it as "ei" (no).
* `atypia`: The report doesn't mention any atypia, so I've marked it as "ei" (no).

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process another report!
