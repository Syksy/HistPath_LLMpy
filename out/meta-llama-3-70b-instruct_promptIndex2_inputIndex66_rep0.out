I apologize, but the provided text is a poem and does not contain any information about a histopathological report or a patient's biopsy samples. It appears to be a personal and emotional reflection on loss and grief.

As a result, I cannot provide answers to the questions you've asked, as there is no relevant information in the text. If you could provide the actual histopathological report or the relevant text, I would be happy to assist you in extracting the necessary information.

Here is the response in JSON format, with "NA" indicating that the information is not available:
