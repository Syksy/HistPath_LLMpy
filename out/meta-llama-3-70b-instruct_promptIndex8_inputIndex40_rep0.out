Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 14,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": "4+3",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "kyllä",
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: 14, because there are 14 samples mentioned (A-D, E-F, G-N, and N-O).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, because no size or weight is mentioned for the samples.
* `Gleason_score`: "4+3", because the prevailing Gleason class is 4 and there is also some class 3.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei", because the report mentions a tumor that infiltrates through the capsule into the fat, indicating malignant growth.
* `perineural_invasion`: "kyllä", because perineural invasion is abundantly observed.
* `atypia`: NA, because there is no mention of atypia in the report.
