Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": null,
  "Gleason_score": "4+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": null,
  "atypia": null
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: 6, as there are six macrosections mentioned in the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, as no specific size or weight is mentioned for each sample.
* `Gleason_score`: "4+4", as the Gleason score is reported to be 4+4 in the apex and mostly 3+4 in the base.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: false, as adenocarcinoma (malignant) is found in the samples.
* `perineural_invasion`: NA, as there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: NA, as there is no mention of atypia in the report.
