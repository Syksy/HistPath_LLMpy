Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 14,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": 4,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: 14, because there are 14 samples mentioned in the report (A-D, E-F, G-N, and N-O).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, because the report does not mention the size or weight of the samples.
* `Gleason_score`: 4, because the report mentions that the predominant Gleason score is 4, with some Gleason score 3 also present.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: false, because the report mentions the presence of cancer (Gleason score 4 and 3) and perineural invasion.
* `perineural_invasion`: true, because the report explicitly mentions the presence of perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: false, because the report does not mention the presence of atypia.
