Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: 6, as there are 6 formalin-fixed preparations (A-F).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, as the size or weight of the samples is not mentioned in the report.
* `Gleason_score`: 7, which is the sum of the Gleason scores 3 and 4 (3+4=7).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: false, as the report mentions Gleason scores, indicating the presence of malignant growth.
* `perineural_invasion`: false, as the report explicitly states that there is no perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: false, as there is no mention of atypia in the report.
