Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions 6 prostate biopsies, so this field is set to 6.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: There is no information about the size or weight of the samples, so this field is set to NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of the Gleason score in the report, so this field is set to NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report states that the samples show benign prostate tissue, and no carcinoma or PIN changes are found, so this field is set to true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so this field is set to false.
* `atypia`: The report states that no significant atypia is found in the epithelial cells, so this field is set to false.
