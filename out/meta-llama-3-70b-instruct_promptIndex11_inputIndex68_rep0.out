I'm happy to help! However, I have to inform you that the provided text does not appear to be a histopathological report, but rather a physics text discussing the concept of work and kinetic energy. Therefore, I will not be able to extract the requested information from the text.

Here is the response in JSON format:

```
{
  "Näytteiden määrä": "NA",
  "Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "NA",
  "Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "Atypia": "NA"
}
```

If you could provide the actual histopathological report, I would be happy to assist you in extracting the requested information.
