Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": "3+4=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: 12, as there are 12 kudosblokkia (tissue blocks) mentioned in the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, as there is no mention of the size or weight of the samples.
* `Gleason_score`: "3+4=7", as the report mentions a Gleason sum of 7, with a major component of 3 and a minor component of 4 (although not explicitly stated).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei", as the report mentions carcinoma (karsinoomaa) in addition to benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: NA, as there is no mention of these features in the report.
