Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "100mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "yes",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions "a representative sample", implying that only one sample has been taken.
2. The sample has a total length of 100mm.
3. There is no mention of the Gleason score in the text, so it's NA (not available).
4. There is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) in the text, so it's NA.
5. The text explicitly mentions "perineural growth", which is suspicious for malignancy, so the answer is "yes".
6. The text does not mention atypia, but it does mention "no clear malignant or PIN findings", implying that atypia is not detected, so the answer is "ei" (no in Finnish).
