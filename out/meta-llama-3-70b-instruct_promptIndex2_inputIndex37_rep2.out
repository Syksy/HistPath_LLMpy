Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("6"),
  "2. Size of samples": ("approx. 120mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("NA"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("kyllä"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("NA"),
  "6. Atypia": ("NA")
}
```

Note: The Gleason score, perineural growth, and atypia were not mentioned in the given report, so I marked them as "NA" (not available).
