Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "(a. Näytteiden määrä)": "NA",
  "(b. Näytteiden koko)": "30g",
  "(c. Gleason-luokitus)": "NA",
  "(d. Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu)": "kyllä",
  "(e. Perineuraalinen kasvu)": "NA",
  "(f. Atypia)": "ei"
}
```

Let me explain the answers:

a. The number of samples taken is not explicitly mentioned, so the answer is "NA".

b. The size of the samples is mentioned as 30g, so the answer is "30g".

c. There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so the answer is "NA".

d. The report mentions "hyvänlaatuista prostatakudosta", which translates to "benign prostatic tissue", so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).

e. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is "NA".

f. The report explicitly states that there is no atypia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
