Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("6"),
  "2. Size of the samples": ("macrosections and normal microscopic sections (no specific size mentioned)"),
  "3. Gleason classification": ("4+4=8" and "3+4=7"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Note: 

* For question 2, the size of the samples is not explicitly mentioned, but it is stated that there are macrosections and normal microscopic sections.
* For question 3, there are two different Gleason classifications mentioned: 4+4=8 for the apex and 3+4=7 for the base.
* For questions 4, 5, and 6, the answers are "ei" (no) because there is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia, perineural growth, or atypia in the given text.
