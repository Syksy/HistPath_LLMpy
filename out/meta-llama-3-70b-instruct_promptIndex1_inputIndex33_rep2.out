I'll go through the questions one by one and provide the answers in JSON format.

**1. Näytteiden määrä:**
The report doesn't explicitly mention the number of samples taken from the patient. Therefore, the answer is:
```
{
  "näytteiden_määrä": "NA"
}
```

**2. Näytteiden koko:**
The report mentions that the total length of the samples is about 60mm on the right and about 80mm on the left. The answer is:
```
{
  "näytteiden_koko": {
    "right": 60,
    "unit": "mm",
    "left": 80
  }
}
```

Let me know when you're ready for me to proceed with the next questions!
