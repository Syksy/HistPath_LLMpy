Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 1, because there is only one sample mentioned in the report.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm", because the report mentions the total length of the biopsy samples.
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention the Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions a focus with atypical glands and a morphological finding consistent with adenocarcinoma, indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": true, because the report mentions tumour-atypia in the focus with atypical glands.
