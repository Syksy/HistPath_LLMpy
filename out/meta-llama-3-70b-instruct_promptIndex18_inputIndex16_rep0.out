Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "8mm and 5mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+4=8 and 3+4=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* "ei" means "no" in Finnish.
* "kyll√§" means "yes" in Finnish, but it's not applicable in this case.
* "NA" means "not applicable" or "not available" in this context.
* The Gleason score is reported as two separate scores, one for the apex and one for the base, as they are different in the sample.
