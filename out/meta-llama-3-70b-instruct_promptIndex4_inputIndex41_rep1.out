Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 13,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "about 180mm",
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary_pattern": 3,
    "secondary_pattern": 4,
    "percentage_of_secondary_pattern": 30
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```
