Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 12,
  "2. Size of samples": ["8mm", "7mm", "5mm"],
  "3. Gleason score": "3+3",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 2, I provided a list of sizes as there are multiple samples with different sizes.
* For question 4, I assumed BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not detected as there is no mention of it in the text.
* For question 5, I marked it as NA (Not Available) as there is no mention of perineural growth in the text.
* For question 6, I marked it as "ei" (no) as the text explicitly states "Ei havaita tuma-atypiaa" which means "No atypia detected".
