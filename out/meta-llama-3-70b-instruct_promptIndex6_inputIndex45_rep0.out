Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Since the report does not mention the size or weight of the samples, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Based on the report, only benign prostate tissue is seen, and no carcinoma or PIN changes are found. Therefore, this field is set to true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've set this field to false.
* `atypia`: The report explicitly states that no significant atypia is observed in the gland epithelia, so I've set this field to false.
