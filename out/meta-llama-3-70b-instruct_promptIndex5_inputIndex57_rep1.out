Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"location": "right base", "size": "8mm"},
    {"location": "right base", "size": "7mm"},
    {"location": "left base", "size": "5mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": 3,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: The number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 12 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: An array of objects containing the location and size of each biopsy. Only the sizes of the biopsies with carcinoma findings are reported.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the carcinoma findings, which is 3 in this case.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether only benign hyperplasia was found. In this case, it's false because carcinoma was found.
* `perineural_invasion`: Not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (not available).
* `atypia`: A boolean indicating whether atypia was found. In this case, it's false because no nuclear atypia was observed.
