Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1, // assuming 4g of tissue is one sample
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Note: 

* `sample_count` is set to 1, assuming that the 4g of tissue is one sample. If this is not the case, please clarify.
* `Gleason_score` is set to NA, as it is not mentioned in the report.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only` is set to true, as the report mentions "hienoisesti prostatahyperplasiaan", which suggests that the sample shows benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia` are set to NA, as they are not mentioned in the report.
