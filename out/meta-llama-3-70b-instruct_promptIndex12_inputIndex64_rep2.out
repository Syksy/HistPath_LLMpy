I'm happy to help! However, I notice that the provided text is an error message and not a pathology report. It seems to be a SQL query error message. Therefore, I cannot extract the requested information from this text.

Here is the response in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": "NA",
  "sample_amount": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA",
  "patient_bph": "NA",
  "sample_perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "sample_atypia": "NA"
}
```

Please provide the actual pathology report, and I'll be happy to assist you in extracting the requested information.
