  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "NA"

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. Näytteiden määrä: The report mentions that "The shavings obtained from planing were cut into 12 tissue blocks", so the answer is 12.
2. Näytteiden koko: There is no mention of the size of the samples, so the answer is "NA".
3. Gleason-luokitus: The report mentions that "In the portion that can be interpreted as neoplastic, Gleason sum is 7, of which the larger portion is class 3, about 60% of the tumor", so the answer is "3+4=7".
4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu: The report mentions that "Carcinoma is seen in a small part of the chips", which implies that there is no benign prostatic hyperplasia, so the answer is "ei".
5. Perineuraalinen kasvu: There is no mention of perineural growth, so the answer is "NA".
6. Atypia: There is no mention of atypia, so the answer is "NA".
