Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": 6,
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": ["4+4=8", "4+3=7", "3+4=7"],
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "kyllä"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of biopsy specimens taken is 6.
2. There is no mention of the size of the biopsy specimens, so the answer is "NA".
3. The Gleason scores are mentioned for three colonies: 4+4=8, 4+3=7, and 3+4=7.
4. The report mentions "hyperplastic changes in the epithelium" in some samples, which suggests that there is no high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) or high-grade dysplasia, so the answer is "ei".
5. There is no mention of perineural invasion, so the answer is "NA".
6. The report mentions "atypical glandular structure" in Colony 1, which suggests that atypia is present, so the answer is "kyllä".
