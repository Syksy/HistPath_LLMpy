Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 8,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions that the sampled prostate electrosection chips have been started in eight blocks, so the number of samples is 8.
2. There is no information about the size of the samples taken, so the answer is "NA".
3. There is no mention of the Gleason score, so the answer is "NA".
4-6. There is no mention of BPH, perineural growth, or atypia in the text, so the answers are all "NA".
