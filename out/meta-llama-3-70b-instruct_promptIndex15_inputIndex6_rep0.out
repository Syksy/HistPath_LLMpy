Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": ("multiple"),
  "2. Näytteiden koko": ("NA"),
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": ("3+4=7/60%/NA"),
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

2. The size of the samples is not specified in the report.
3. The Gleason score is 7, with a major component of 3 and a minor component of 4, and it accounts for 60% of the findings.
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or any other type of benign growth, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural invasion, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
