I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text does not appear to be a real medical note written by a pathologist in Finnish. The text seems to be a mix of nonsensical phrases and numbers.

Assuming this is a test or a hypothetical scenario, I'll do my best to provide answers based on the instructions. Since the text does not contain any relevant information, I'll respond with "NA" (Not Available) for each question.

Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": "NA",
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Please provide a real medical note in Finnish, and I'll do my best to extract the relevant information.
