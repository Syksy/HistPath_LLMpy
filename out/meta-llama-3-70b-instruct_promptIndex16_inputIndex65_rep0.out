As a highly experienced histopathologist, I've carefully reviewed the provided statement. Unfortunately, the statement does not contain sufficient information to answer the questions accurately. The statement appears to be a summary of the patient's medical history and does not provide detailed information about the biopsy samples.

Here are my responses in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "NA",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "NA",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "NA"
}
```

The statement does not provide information about the number of biopsy samples, their size, Gleason score, or any specific histopathological findings. Therefore, I've marked all answers as "NA" (Not Available).
