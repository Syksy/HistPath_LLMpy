Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 14, 
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA, 
  "Gleason_score": "4+3", 
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei", 
  "perineural_invasion": "kyllä", 
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: 14, because there are 14 samples mentioned in the report (A-D, E-F, G-N, and N-O).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, because the report does not mention the size or weight of the samples.
* `Gleason_score`: "4+3", because the report mentions that the dominant Gleason score is 4, with some areas also showing score 3.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei", because the report mentions that there are areas with cancerous growth.
* `perineural_invasion`: "kyllä", because the report explicitly states that perineural invasion is present.
* `atypia`: NA, because the report does not mention anything about atypia.
