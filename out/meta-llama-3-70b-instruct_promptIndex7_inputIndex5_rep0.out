Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "5g",
  "Gleason_score": 8,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 1, because the report mentions a single sample of prostate tissue.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "5g", because the report specifies the weight of the sample.
* "Gleason_score": 8, because the report mentions a Gleason score of 8.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor.
* "perineural_invasion" and "atypia": NA, because the report does not mention these specific features.
