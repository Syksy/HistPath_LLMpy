Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": "multiple",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": "7 (3+4)",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The report mentions multiple samples (D-G apex, basis K-P, seminaalivehikkeleitä O-Q), so I've entered "multiple" as the value.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: There is no mention of sample size or weight in the report, so I've entered "NA".
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa, with a score of 3 in approximately 60% of the findings. I've entered this as "7 (3+4)".
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions tuumori (tumor) and kasvainta (cancer), indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia. So, I've entered "ei" (no).
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineuraalista eli neuronien ympäröivää pahanlaatuista kasvua in the report, so I've entered "ei" (no).
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypiaa eli tavallisesta kudoksesta poikkeavia muutoksia in the report, so I've entered "ei" (no).
