Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30mm",
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 3, because the report mentions "kolme fuusiobiopsiaa" (three fusion biopsies).
* "sample_size_or_weight": "30mm", because the report mentions "yhteispituudesta 30mm" (total length of 30mm).
* "Gleason_score": 7, because the report mentions "löyydös score 7" (finding score 7).
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions "karsinoomafokuksia" (carcinoma foci), which indicates malignant growth.
* "perineural_invasion" and "atypia": NA, because these features are not mentioned in the report.
