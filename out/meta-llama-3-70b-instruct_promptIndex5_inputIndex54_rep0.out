Based on the provided free-text histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 8,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 8 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Since the report doesn't mention the size or weight of the samples, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report states that the finding is benign, and only regular prostate tissue is present, indicating that there is only benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've marked it as false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I've marked it as false.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more reports!
