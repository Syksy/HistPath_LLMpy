Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 14,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary": 4,
    "secondary": 3
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: There are 14 samples mentioned in the report (A-D, E-F, G-N, and N-O).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: No information is provided about the size or weight of the samples, so NA is returned.
* `Gleason_score`: The primary Gleason score is 4, and there is also some component of score 3.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This is set to false because the report mentions cancerous foci with a Gleason score.
* `perineural_invasion`: This is set to true because the report explicitly states that perineural invasion is present.
* `atypia`: No information is provided about atypia, so NA is returned.
