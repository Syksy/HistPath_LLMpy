I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text does not contain any relevant information about a histopathological report of a prostate cancer sample. The text appears to be a mix of random words and phrases.

As a result, I cannot provide answers to the questions based on the given text. If you could provide the actual histopathological report or a relevant text, I would be happy to assist you in extracting the necessary information.

Here is an empty JSON object as a response:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "NA",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "NA",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "NA"
}
```

Please provide the actual report, and I'll do my best to extract the necessary information for you!
