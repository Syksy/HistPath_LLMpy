Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "10g",
  "Gleason_score": "5+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: The text mentions "prostate shavings" which implies a single sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The text states that 10g of the material was sent for histology.
* `Gleason_score`: The text explicitly mentions the Gleason score as 5 and 4, so I combined them into a single value.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The text describes a "carpet-like malignant growth", which indicates that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These values are not mentioned in the original text, so I returned NA (Not Available) instead of making an uncertain assumption.
