Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 12,
  "2. Size of samples": ["8mm", "7mm", "5mm"],
  "3. Gleason score": "3+3=6/6/NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Note: 

* "ei" means "no" in Finnish.
* "NA" means "not available" or "not mentioned" in the text.
* The Gleason score is reported as major+minor=sum/sum/NA, where "sum" is the total Gleason score and "NA" indicates that there is no additional information.
