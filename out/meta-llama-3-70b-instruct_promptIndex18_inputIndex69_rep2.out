I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text does not appear to be a medical note written by a pathologist in Finnish. The text seems to be a poetic or fictional passage, and it does not contain any relevant information about medical samples or diagnoses.

As a result, I must provide the following answers:

{
"1. Number of samples": NA,
"2. Size of samples": NA,
"3. Gleason score": NA,
"4. BPH detection": NA,
"5. Perineural growth detection": NA,
"6. Atypia detection": NA
}

If you could provide a genuine medical note in Finnish, I would be happy to assist you in extracting the relevant information.
