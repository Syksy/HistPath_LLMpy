Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": "NA",
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

The reason for all "NA" answers is that the provided text does not contain any information about samples, their size, Gleason score, or detection of BPH, perineural growth, or atypia. The text appears to be a medical note describing a patient's condition and treatment, but it does not contain any information related to pathology samples or their analysis.
