}

Note: 

* For question 1, the number of samples is not explicitly stated, so I answered NA.
* For question 2, the total length of the samples is approximately 150mm, but it's not clear if this is the size of each sample or the total length of all samples. I assumed it's the total length.
* For question 3, there is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I answered NA.
* For question 4, there is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia, so I answered ei.
* For question 5, there is no mention of perineural growth, so I answered NA.
* For question 6, nuclear atypia is mentioned in the report, so I answered kyllä.
