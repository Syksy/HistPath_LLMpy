Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 3,
  "2. Size of samples": "90mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "yes",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "no"
}
```

Note: 

* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as "NA" (not available).
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is suspected due to the presence of hyperplastic changes, so it's marked as "yes".
* There is no mention of perineural growth, so it's marked as "NA".
* Atypia is explicitly mentioned as not being present, so it's marked as "no".
