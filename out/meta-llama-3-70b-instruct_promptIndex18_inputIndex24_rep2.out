* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as "NA".
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) can be detected, as the text mentions "pääasiassa säännöllistä prostatakudosta" which means "mainly regular prostate tissue", and "löydös siis benigni" which means "the finding is thus benign".
* Perineural growth and atypia are not mentioned in the text, so they are marked as "ei" (no).
