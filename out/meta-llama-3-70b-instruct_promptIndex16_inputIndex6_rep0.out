Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": ("multiple"),
  "2. Näytteiden koko": ("not specified"),
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": ("3+4=7/60%/NA"),
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples taken is multiple, as the report mentions different samples from the apex (D-G), basis (K-P), and seminal vesicles (O-Q).
2. The size of the samples is not specified in the report.
3. The Gleason score is 3+4=7, with 60% of the tumor having a score of 3.
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or any other type of benign growth in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
