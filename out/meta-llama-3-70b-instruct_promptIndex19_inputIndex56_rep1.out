Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 12,
  "2. Size of samples": "150 mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyllä",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text states "12 representative needle biopsies", so the number of samples is 12.
2. The total length of the samples is about 150 mm, so that's the size of the samples.
3. There is no mention of Gleason score in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
4. The text mentions "hyperplastic-like epithelium", which is a characteristic of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. The text does not mention atypia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
