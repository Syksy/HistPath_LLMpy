Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient is not explicitly mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions that a total of 4g of planing chips were obtained, so I've filled in this field with the weight.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I've marked it as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report suggests subtly prostatic hyperplasia, which implies that only benign hyperplasia is present, so I've set this field to true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've set this field to false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia or any abnormal changes in the report, so I've set this field to false.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to clarify any of these fields!
