Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "6",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "ei",

}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

2. The size of the biopsy samples is not specified in the report.
3. There is no Gleason score mentioned in the report, so it's NA (not applicable).
4. There is no evidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. The report states that there is no significant atypia in the epithelial cells, so the answer is "ei" (no).
