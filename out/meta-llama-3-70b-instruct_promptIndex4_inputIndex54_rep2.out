Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 8,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: 8, as mentioned in the report ("eight blocks")
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, as this information is not provided in the report
* `Gleason_score`: NA, as this information is not provided in the report
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: true, as the report states that the finding is benign and only shows regular prostate tissue
* `perineural_invasion`: false, as there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report
* `atypia`: false, as there is no mention of atypia or any abnormal changes in the report
