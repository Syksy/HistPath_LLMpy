Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": "6",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30g",
  "Gleason_score": "NA",
  "benign_hyperplasia": "kyllä",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case (mentioned in the phrase "kuudessa blokissa").
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total weight of the samples, which is 30g (mentioned in the phrase "noin 30g").
* `Gleason_score`: Not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia`: The report suggests that the finding is consistent with benign hyperplasia, so this field is marked as "kyllä".
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so this field is marked as "ei".
* `atypia`: The report explicitly states that there is no atypia, so this field is marked as "ei".
