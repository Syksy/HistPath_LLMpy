Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 9, // A-C, D-E, F-G, H-I
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary_grade": 3,
    "secondary_grade": 4
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is inferred from the text as 9 (A-C, D-E, F-G, H-I).
* The sample size or weight is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA.
* The Gleason score is reported as a combination of primary grade 3 and secondary grade 4.
* The report mentions a large tumor, so it's not considered benign hyperplasia only.
* There is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the report, so they are marked as NA.
