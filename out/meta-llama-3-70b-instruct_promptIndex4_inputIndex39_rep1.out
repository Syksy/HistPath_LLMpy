Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 8,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "13g",
  "Gleason_score": "3+3=6",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "NA",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 8 in this case, as indicated by the phrase "eight cassettes".
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total weight of the samples, which is 13g.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the carcinoma, which is 3+3=6.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since the report mentions carcinoma, it's clear that it's not a case of benign hyperplasia only, but the report doesn't explicitly state this, so I've marked it as "NA" (not available).
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've marked it as "NA".
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I've marked it as "NA".
