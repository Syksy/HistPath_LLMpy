Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("4"),
  "2. Size of samples": ("NA"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("4+3=7"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("NA"),
  "6. Atypia": ("NA")
}
```

Note: 

* For question 2, the size of the samples is not specified, so I answered "NA" (not available).
* For question 4, there is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia, so I answered "ei" (no).
* For questions 5 and 6, there is no mention of perineural growth or atypia, so I answered "NA" (not available).
