Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "120mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": "kyllä",
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "sample_count": 6, because the report mentions "6 kpl edustavia prostatabiopsioita" (6 representative prostate biopsies).
* "sample_size_or_weight": "120mm", because the report mentions "yhteensä n. 120mm" (total of approximately 120mm).
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention a Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia": "kyllä", because the report mentions "basaalisoluhyperplasiaa" (basal cell hyperplasia), which is a type of benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": NA, because the report does not mention atypia.
