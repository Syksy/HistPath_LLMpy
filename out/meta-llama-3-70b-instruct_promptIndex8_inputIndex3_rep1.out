Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": "2",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "60mm, 80mm",
  "Gleason_score": "9 (4+5)",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: There are two biopsy samples taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total length of the samples is approximately 60mm and 80mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is 9, with a major component of 4 and a minor component of 5.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The sample does not only show benign hyperplasia, as cancer is present.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These values are not mentioned in the original report, so they are marked as NA (not available).
