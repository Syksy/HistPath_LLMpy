Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": "2",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "60mm, 80mm",
  "Gleason_score": "9 (4+5)",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Since there are two biopsies mentioned, I assumed the sample count is 2.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the biopsies are mentioned in millimeters, so I included both values.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is mentioned as 9, with a breakdown of 4+5.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since the report mentions carcinoma, I assumed this field is "ei" (no).
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are not mentioned in the report, so I marked them as "NA" (not available).
