It seems like the provided text is not a histopathological report, but rather a medical report from an emergency department. There is no information about biopsies, Gleason scores, or other histopathological findings.

Here is the structured report in JSON format, with NA values for all fields:

```
{
  "number_of_biopsies": "NA",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": "NA",
  "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia": "NA",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Please provide a histopathological report, and I'll be happy to help you structure it!
