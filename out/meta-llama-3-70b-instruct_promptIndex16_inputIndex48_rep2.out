Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("6"),
  "2. Sample size": ("4mm, 6mm, 3mm, 5mm, 7mm, 8mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("NA"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 6, as there are 3 samples from the left and 3 samples from the right.
* The sample sizes are listed as 4mm, 6mm, 3mm, 5mm, 7mm, and 8mm, as mentioned in the report.
* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so it is marked as "NA" (not available).
* There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia, perineural growth, or atypia in the report, so they are all marked as "ei" (no).
