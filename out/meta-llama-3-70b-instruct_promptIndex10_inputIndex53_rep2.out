Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

{
"(Näytteiden määrä)": 3,
"(Näytteiden koko)": [8, 6, 10, 5, 5],
"(Gleason-luokitus)": 7,
"(Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu)": "ei",
"(Perineuraalinen kasvu)": "NA",
"(Atypia)": "kyllä"
}

Note: For question 2, I provided a list of lengths since there are multiple samples with different lengths. For question 4, I answered "ei" since the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor, not a benign growth. For question 5, I answered "NA" since there is no mention of perineural growth in the report. For question 6, I answered "kyllä" since the report mentions PIN changes, which are a type of atypia.
