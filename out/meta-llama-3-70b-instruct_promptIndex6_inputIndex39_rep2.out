Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 8,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "13g",
  "Gleason_score": "3+3=6",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "NA",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:
