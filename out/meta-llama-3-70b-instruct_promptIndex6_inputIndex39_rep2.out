Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 8,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "13g",
  "Gleason_score": "3+3=6",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 8 in this case (mentioned as "eight cassettes").
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total weight of the planing chips, which is 13g.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the carcinoma, which is 3+3=6.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia or not. In this case, since carcinoma was found, the value is set to false.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are marked as NA (Not Available) since there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the original report.
