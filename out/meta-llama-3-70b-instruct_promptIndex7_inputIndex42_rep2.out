Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 12, because the report mentions that the shavings were cut into 12 tissue blocks.
* "sample_size_or_weight": NA, because the report does not provide information about the size or weight of the samples.
* "Gleason_score": 7, because the report mentions that the Gleason sum is 7.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions that carcinoma is seen in a small part of the chips, indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because the report does not provide information about perineural invasion.
* "atypia": NA, because the report does not provide information about atypia.
