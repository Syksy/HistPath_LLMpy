Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("D-G" and "K-P" and "O-Q", so 12-14 samples),
  "2. Size of samples": (not specified),
  "3. Gleason score": (3+4=7/7/NA),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": (ei),
  "5. Perineural growth": (ei),
  "6. Atypia": (ei)
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is estimated to be between 12-14, as there are 4 specimens labeled D-G, 7 specimens labeled K-P, and 3 specimens labeled O-Q.
* The size of the samples is not specified in the report.
* The Gleason score is 3+4=7, which means the primary pattern is 3 and the secondary pattern is 4, with a total score of 7.
* There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the report, so it is assumed to be absent.
* There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so it is assumed to be absent.
* There is no mention of atypia in the report, so it is assumed to be absent.
