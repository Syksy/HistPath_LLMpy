Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30mm",
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of biopsy samples taken from the patient, which is 3 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total length of the biopsy samples, which is 30mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the cancerous tissue, which is 7 (3+4).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, it's false because cancerous tissue is present.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field indicates whether perineural invasion (i.e., cancerous growth around nerves) is present. In this case, it's false because it's not mentioned in the report.
* `atypia`: This field indicates whether atypia (i.e., abnormal cell changes) is present. In this case, it's false because it's not mentioned in the report.
