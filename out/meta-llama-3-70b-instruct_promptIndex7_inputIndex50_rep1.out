Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_biopsies": 6,
  "biopsy_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": [
    {"score": 8, "primary": 4, "secondary": 4},
    {"score": 7, "primary": 4, "secondary": 3},
    {"score": 7, "primary": 3, "secondary": 4}
  ],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Note: 

* The number of biopsies is 6, as stated in the report.
* The size or weight of the biopsies is not mentioned, so it is reported as NA.
* The Gleason scores are reported as an array, since there are multiple scores mentioned in the report.
* The report mentions adenocarcinoma, which means it's not a case of benign hyperplasia only, so the value is set to false.
* There is no mention of perineural invasion, so it is reported as NA.
* Atypia is mentioned in the report, so the value is set to true.
