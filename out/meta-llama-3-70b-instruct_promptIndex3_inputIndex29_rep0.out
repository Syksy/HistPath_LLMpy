Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 3,
  "2. Size of samples": "7, 6 and 2mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "7",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 4, 5, and 6, I answered "NA" because there is no mention of BPH, perineural growth, or atypia in the provided text.
