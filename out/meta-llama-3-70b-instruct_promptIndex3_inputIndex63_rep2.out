I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text does not appear to be a histopathological prostate cancer sample statement. The text seems to be a medical note describing a patient's visit to the emergency room due to a shoulder injury.

As a result, I cannot extract the requested information from the text. Here is the response in JSON format:

{
"1. Number of samples": "NA",
"2. Size of samples": "NA",
"3. Gleason score": "NA",
"4. BPH detection": "NA",
"5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
"6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}

Please provide a valid histopathological prostate cancer sample statement, and I'll be happy to assist you in extracting the required information.
