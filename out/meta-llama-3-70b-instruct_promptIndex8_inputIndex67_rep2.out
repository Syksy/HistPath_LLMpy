Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the result:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

The text does not contain any specific information about the number of samples, their size or weight, Gleason score, or any other relevant details. Therefore, I have assigned "NA" (Not Available) to all fields.
