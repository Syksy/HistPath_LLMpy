Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "12.3g",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyllä",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions "the sample", implying that only one sample has been taken.
2. The size of the sample is 12.3g, as mentioned in the text.
3. There is no mention of Gleason score in the text, so it's NA (not available).
4. The text mentions "stromal hyperplasia", which is a characteristic of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH), so it's likely that BPH can be detected in the sample (kyllä).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so it's NA (not available).
6. The text does not suggest any atypia, so it's "ei" (no).
