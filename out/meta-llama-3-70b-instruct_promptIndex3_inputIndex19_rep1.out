Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "12.3g",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "yes",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is assumed to be 1 since the text mentions "yhdell√§ kasetilla" which means "with one cassette".
* The size of the samples is mentioned as 12.3g.
* There is no mention of Gleason score, so it's marked as NA.
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) can be detected, as the text mentions "strooman hyperplasiasta" which translates to "stromal hyperplasia", a characteristic of BPH.
* There is no mention of perineural growth or atypia, so they are marked as NA.
