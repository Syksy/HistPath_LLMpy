Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150 mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of needle biopsies taken from the patient, which is 12 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total length of the samples, which is approximately 150 mm.
* `Gleason_score`: Since the Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, the value is set to NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field is set to true, indicating that the report suggests mostly benign growth.
* `perineural_invasion`: Since there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, this field is set to false.
* `atypia`: Similarly, since there is no mention of atypia in the report, this field is set to false.
