Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary_grade": 4,
    "secondary_grade": 3
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 4 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Since the report doesn't mention the size or weight of the samples, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is a grading system used to evaluate the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. In this case, the primary grade is 4, and the secondary grade is 3.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., non-cancerous growth). Since the report mentions adenocarcinoma, I've marked it as false.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are marked as NA since there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the report.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to clarify any of these fields!
