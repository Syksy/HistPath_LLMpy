Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: 6, as there are 6 biopsy samples taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, as the size or weight of the samples is not mentioned in the report.
* `Gleason_score`: NA, as the Gleason score is not applicable for benign biopsies.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: true, as the report mentions that only benign prostatic tissue is seen in the samples.
* `perineural_invasion`: false, as there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: false, as the report explicitly states that no significant atypia is seen in the epithelial cells.
