Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12, // assuming 12 samples (D-G, K-P, O-Q)
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: Based on the report, there are multiple specimens (D-G, K-P, O-Q), which I assume to be 12 individual samples.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: There is no mention of sample size or weight in the report, so I return NA.
* `Gleason_score`: The report explicitly states that the tumor is Gleason level 7 carcinoma.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions a tumor with a Gleason score of 7, indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia, so I set this to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I return NA.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I return NA.

Please note that some values are returned as NA because they cannot be determined from the provided report.
