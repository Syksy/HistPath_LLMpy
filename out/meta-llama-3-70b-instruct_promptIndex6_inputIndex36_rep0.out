Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12, // assuming 12 samples based on the mention of specimens D-G, K-P, and O-Q
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA, // no information provided
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, // since carcinoma is mentioned
  "perineural_invasion": NA, // no information provided
  "atypia": NA // no information provided
}
```

Note that I had to make an assumption about the number of samples based on the mention of specimens, but this may not be entirely accurate. Additionally, there was no information provided about the sample size or weight, perineural invasion, or atypia, so I had to return NA for those fields.
