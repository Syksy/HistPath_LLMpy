Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+3=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions 6 samples taken from different regions of the prostate (base right, center right, apex right, base left, center left, and apex left).
2. The size of the samples is not explicitly mentioned, so I've marked it as "NA" (not available).
3. The Gleason score is reported as 4+3=7, which indicates a Gleason score of 7 with a primary pattern of 4 and a secondary pattern of 3.
4. There is no mention of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the text, so I've marked it as "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so I've marked it as "NA" (not available).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so I've marked it as "ei" (no).
