Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "(6)",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "(NA)",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "(NA)",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "(ei)",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "(ei)",
  "6. Atypia": "(ei)"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has 6 biopsy samples.
2. The size of the biopsy samples is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
3. There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so it's marked as NA.
4. The report states that there is no carcinoma or PIN changes, and only benign prostate tissue is seen, so there is no evidence of high-grade prostate cancer or atypia.
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so it's marked as NA.
6. The report explicitly states that there is no significant atypia seen in the epithelial cells, so the answer is "ei" (no).
