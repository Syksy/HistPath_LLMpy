Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 3,
  "2. Size of samples": "7, 6 and 2mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 3 as mentioned in the text ("Three fusion biopsies...").
* The size of the samples is given as 7, 6, and 2mm.
* The Gleason score is calculated as 3+4=7 based on the text ("level 3 grade growth...Gleaosn type 4...").
* There is no mention of BPH, perineural growth, or atypia in the text, so the answers for these questions are 'NA' (not available).
