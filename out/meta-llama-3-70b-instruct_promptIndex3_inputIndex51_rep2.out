Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 3,
  "2. Size of samples": "4g",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "yes",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 3, as mentioned in the text ("launched into three tissue cassettes").
* The size of the samples is 4g, as mentioned in the text.
* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as "NA".
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) can be detected, as mentioned in the text ("findings would suggest subtly prostatic hyperplasia").
* There is no mention of perineural growth or atypia in the text, so they are marked as "NA".
