Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1, // Assuming one sample is referred to as "prostatektomia-preparaatti"
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA, // No information available
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, // Since Gleason score is 7, it's not just benign hyperplasia
  "perineural_invasion": false, // No mention of perineural invasion
  "atypia": false // No mention of atypia
}
```

Note that I've assumed the number of samples to be 1, as the report refers to a single "prostatektomia-preparaatti". If this is incorrect, please let me know. Also, I've marked "sample_size_or_weight" as NA, as there is no information available in the report.
