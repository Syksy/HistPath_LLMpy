Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 2,
  "sample_size": {
    "right": "60mm",
    "left": "80mm"
  },
  "gleason_score": {
    "primary": 4,
    "secondary": 5,
    "total": 9
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 2 in this case (one from the right and one from the left).
* `sample_size`: The size of each sample, specified as the length in millimeters.
* `gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the sample, broken down into primary, secondary, and total scores.
* `benign_hyperplasia`: A boolean indicating whether the sample shows only benign hyperplasia (false in this case, since cancer was detected).
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are marked as NA (Not Available) since there is no mention of them in the original report.
