Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "2mm",
  "Gleason_score": "4+3",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 4 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size of the sample, which is 2mm in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score, which is 4+3 in this case, indicating a major grade of 4 and a minor grade of 3.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor, this field is set to "ei" (no).
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are set to "NA" since there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the report.
