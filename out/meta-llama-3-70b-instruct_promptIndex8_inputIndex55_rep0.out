Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "2mm",
  "Gleason_score": "4+3",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: 4, as there are 4 samples mentioned (Samples 1-4).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: "2mm", as the size of the adenocarcinoma area is approximately 2mm.
* `Gleason_score`: "4+3", as the most prevalent Gleason grade is 4, and grade 3 is almost as large a percentage.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei", as the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: both are "NA", as there is no mention of these features in the report.
