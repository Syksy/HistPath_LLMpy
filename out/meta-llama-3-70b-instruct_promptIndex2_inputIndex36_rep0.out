Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("D-G" + "K-P" + "O-Q" = 12),
  "2. Size of the samples": ("NA"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("3+4=7"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("NA")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples taken is 12, as there are 4 samples from the apex (D-G), 7 samples from the base (K-P), and 3 samples from the seminal vesicles (O-Q).
2. The size of the samples is not specified in the report, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
3. The Gleason score is 7, with a primary score of 3 and a secondary score of 4.
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
