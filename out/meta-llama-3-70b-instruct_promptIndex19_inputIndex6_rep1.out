Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 3,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7/60%/NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

3. The Gleason score is mentioned as 7, with a major component of 3 and a minor component of 4, and the percentage of involvement is 60%.
4. There is no mention of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the text, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so the answer is "ei" (no).
