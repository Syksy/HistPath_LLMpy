Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total weight of the samples, which is approximately 30g.
* `Gleason_score`: Since the Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the report only shows benign hyperplasia, which is true in this case.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've marked it as false.
* `atypia`: The report explicitly states that there is no atypia, so I've marked it as false.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
