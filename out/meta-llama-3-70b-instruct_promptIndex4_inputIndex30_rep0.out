Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "100mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Not mentioned in the report, so NA.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions a total length of 100mm, so that's the value used.
* `Gleason_score`: Not mentioned in the report, so NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions "suspicious for malignancy", so it's not just benign hyperplasia, hence false.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly mentions "perineural growth", so true.
* `atypia`: The report doesn't mention atypia, and the "no clear malignant or PIN findings" suggests that there are no atypical changes, so false.
