Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "19g",
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary": 5,
    "secondary": 4
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Note: 

* `sample_count` is NA because the number of samples is not explicitly mentioned in the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight` is "19g" which is the total weight of the prostate shavings.
* `Gleason_score` is an object with primary and secondary scores, which are 5 and 4 respectively.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only` is false because the report mentions a malignant growth.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia` are both NA because they are not mentioned in the report.
