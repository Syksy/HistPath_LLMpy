I'm happy to help! However, I notice that the provided text is not a histopathological report, but rather a general information text about prostate cancer. It does not contain any specific patient data or biopsy results.

If you could provide an actual histopathological report, I'd be happy to help you convert it into a structured format in JSON. Please provide the report, and I'll do my best to extract the relevant information and answer the questions you've listed.
