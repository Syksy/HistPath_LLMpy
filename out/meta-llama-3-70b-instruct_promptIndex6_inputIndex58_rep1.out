Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: 6 samples were taken from the patient, as indicated in the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report does not provide information on the size or weight of the samples, so I've marked it as "NA" (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is 7, which is a combination of Gleason 4 and Gleason 3 patterns (4+3=7).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report indicates that the growth patterns are not only benign hyperplasia, but also show poorly differentiated Gleason 4+3=7 growth, so this field is set to `false`.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report does not mention perineural invasion, so I've marked it as "NA" (Not Available).
* `atypia`: The report does not mention atypia, so I've marked it as "NA" (Not Available).
