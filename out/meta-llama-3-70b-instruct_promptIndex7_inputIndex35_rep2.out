Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "5g",
  "Gleason_score": 8,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples" is set to 1, as the report mentions a single sample of prostate shavings.
* "sample_size_or_weight" is set to "5g", as the report specifies the weight of the sample.
* "Gleason_score" is set to 8, as the report explicitly states the Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only" is set to false, as the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor.
* "perineural_invasion" and "atypia" are both set to NA, as there is no mention of these features in the report.
