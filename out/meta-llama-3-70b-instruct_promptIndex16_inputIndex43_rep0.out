```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": ("19g"),
  "2. Näytteiden koko": ("10g"),
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": ("5+4=9/9/NA"),
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("kyllä")
}

Note: 

* For question 1, the answer is "19g" which is the total amount of prostate shavings taken from the patient.
* For question 2, the answer is "10g" which is the amount of tissue put into histology.
* For question 3, the answer is "5+4=9/9/NA" which is the Gleason classification, with the highest level being 5 and the second highest level being 4.
* For question 4, the answer is "ei" (no) because the report does not mention any benign prostatic hyperplasia.
* For question 5, the answer is "ei" (no) because the report does not mention any perineural invasion.
* For question 6, the answer is "kyllä" (yes) because the report describes a "carpet-like malignant growth" and "enlarged" nuclei with "clearly distinguished" nuclear grains, which are indicative of atypia.
