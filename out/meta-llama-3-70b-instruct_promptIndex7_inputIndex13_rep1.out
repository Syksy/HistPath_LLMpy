Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "19g",
  "Gleason_score": "5+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "NA",
  "perineural_invasion": "yes",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 1, because the report mentions a single prostate sample.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "19g", because the report mentions the weight of the sample.
* "Gleason_score": "5+4", because the report mentions the Gleason score with the most common pattern being grade 5 and the second most common being grade 4.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": "NA", because the report does not explicitly state that the sample only shows benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": "yes", because the report mentions "pahanlaatuista kasvua stroomassa", which indicates perineural invasion.
* "atypia": "NA", because the report does not mention atypia or any changes that would suggest atypia.
