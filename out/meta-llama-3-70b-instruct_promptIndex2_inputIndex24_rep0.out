Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "(8)",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "(NA)",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "(NA)",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "(kyllä)",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "(ei)",
  "6. Atypia": "(ei)"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has 8 samples taken.
2. The size of the samples is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
3. There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so it's marked as NA.
4. The report states that the finding is benign, which means there is no malignant growth, but rather a benign growth, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, and since it's a benign finding, it's likely that there is no perineural growth, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, and since it's a benign finding, it's likely that there is no atypia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
