Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Since the report doesn't mention the exact number of samples taken, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions that about 30g of planing chips were received, so I've filled in this field with that value.
* `Gleason_score`: Since the report doesn't mention a Gleason score, I've marked it as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia`: The report concludes that the finding is suitable for suspected benign hyperplasia, so I've marked this field as true.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report doesn't mention perineural invasion, so I've marked this field as false.
* `atypia`: The report explicitly states that no atypia is visible, so I've marked this field as false.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more reports!
