Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("4"),
  "2. Size of the samples": ("10 mm, 7 mm, 15 mm, 10 mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("3+4=7"),
  "4. Is there benign prostatic hyperplasia?": ("ei"),
  "5. Is there perineural growth?": ("kyll√§"),
  "6. Is there atypia?": ("NA")
}
```

Note: 

* For question 4, I assumed that "benign prostatic hyperplasia" refers to a non-malignant condition, and since the report mentions carcinoma cells, I answered "ei".
* For question 6, I answered "NA" because the report does not mention atypia explicitly.
