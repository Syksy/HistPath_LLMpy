I apologize, but the provided text "Beep boop? Boop biip. Blarp!" does not appear to be a legitimate medical note written by a pathologist in Finnish. It seems to be a nonsensical sequence of words.

As a result, I am unable to extract any meaningful information from the text. Here is the response in JSON format:

{
"1. Number of samples": NA,
"2. Size of samples": NA,
"3. Gleason score": NA,
"4. BPH detection": NA,
"5. Perineural growth detection": NA,
"6. Atypia detection": NA
}

Please provide a legitimate medical note in Finnish, and I will do my best to extract the required information.
