Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": [
    {"sample": "Pesäke 1", "score": 8, "primary": 4, "secondary": 4},
    {"sample": "Pesäke 2", "score": 7, "primary": 4, "secondary": 3},
    {"sample": "Pesäke 3", "score": 7, "primary": 3, "secondary": 4}
  ],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Note: I assumed that the Gleason score is reported for each sample separately, so I created an array of objects to represent this. If this is not the case, please let me know and I'll adjust the output accordingly.
