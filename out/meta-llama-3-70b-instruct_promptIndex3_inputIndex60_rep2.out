I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text "Beep boop? Boop biip. Blarp!" does not appear to be a valid histopathological prostate cancer sample statement in Finnish. It seems to be a nonsensical sequence of words.

If you could provide a real histopathological prostate cancer sample statement in Finnish, I would be happy to assist you in extracting the required information.

Please provide a valid sample statement, and I'll do my best to extract the answers to the questions in JSON format.
