Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": "multiple",
  "2. Size of samples": "150mm (total length)",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "kyllä"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 1, the text does not specify the exact number of samples, but mentions "sample 1B" and "other samples", so I answered "multiple".
* For question 3, the Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so I answered "NA" (not available).
* For question 4, there is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) in the text, so I answered "ei" (no).
* For question 5, there is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so I answered "NA" (not available).
* For question 6, the text mentions "nuclear atypia" in sample 1B, so I answered "kyllä" (yes).
