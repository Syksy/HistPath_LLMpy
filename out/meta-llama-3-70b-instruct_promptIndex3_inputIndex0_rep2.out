Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "100mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "yes",
  "6. Atypia detection": "no"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is assumed to be 1 since the text does not explicitly mention multiple samples.
* The size of the sample is mentioned as 100mm.
* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as 'NA'.
* There is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) in the text, so it's marked as 'NA'.
* Perineural growth is mentioned as "Havaitaan perineuraalia kasvua", which translates to "Perineural growth is detected".
* Atypia is not explicitly mentioned, but the text mentions "ei selkeää malignia tai PIN löydöstä", which means "no clear malignancy or PIN found", implying that atypia is not detected.
