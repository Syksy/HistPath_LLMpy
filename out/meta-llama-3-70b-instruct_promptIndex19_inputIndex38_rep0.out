Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "about 30g",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyllä",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions that "about 20g were started in six blocks", implying that 6 samples were taken.
2. The total weight of the planing chips is about 30g, but the size of each individual sample is not specified.
3. There is no mention of the Gleason score in the text, so it is marked as NA (not available).
4. The text mentions "suspected benign hyperplasia", which is a synonym for BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia), so it is marked as "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so it is marked as NA (not available).
6. The text explicitly states that "no atypia... is visible", so it is marked as "ei" (no).
