Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("6"),
  "2. Sample size": ("NA"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("NA"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("kyllä"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples is 6, as mentioned in the report.
2. The sample size is not specified in the report, so I've marked it as "NA" (not available).
3. There is no Gleason score mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as "NA".
4. The report mentions that benign prostate tissue is seen, which implies that there is benign prostatic hyperplasia, so I've marked it as "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so I've marked it as "ei" (no).
6. The report explicitly states that no significant atypia is observed, so I've marked it as "ei" (no).
