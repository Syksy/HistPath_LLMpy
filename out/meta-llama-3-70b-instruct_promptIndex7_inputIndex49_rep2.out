Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "12.3g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 1, because the report mentions "the sample" (singular), implying that only one sample was taken.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "12.3g", as mentioned in the report.
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention the Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": true, because the report mentions "stromal hyperplasia" and "nothing directly suggestive of malignancy is visible", implying that the sample shows only benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": false, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": false, because the report does not mention atypia or any other abnormal changes.
