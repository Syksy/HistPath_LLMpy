Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12, // assuming 12 samples (D-G, K-P, O-Q)
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is estimated based on the mention of multiple specimens (D-G, K-P, O-Q).
* Sample size or weight is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA.
* Gleason score is explicitly mentioned as 7.
* Benign prostatic hyperplasia only is set to false since the report mentions carcinoma.
* Perineural invasion and atypia are not mentioned in the report, so they are marked as NA.
