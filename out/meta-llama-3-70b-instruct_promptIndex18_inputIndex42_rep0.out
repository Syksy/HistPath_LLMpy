Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 12,
  "2. Size of samples": NA,
  "3. Gleason score": 7/3+4/,
  "4. BPH detection": NA,
  "5. Perineural growth detection": NA,
  "6. Atypia detection": NA
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 12, as mentioned in the text.
* The size of samples is not mentioned in the text, so it's NA (Not Available).
* The Gleason score is 7, with the larger portion being class 3 (about 60% of the tumor), so it's written as 7/3+4/.
* There is no mention of BPH, perineural growth, or atypia in the text, so the answers are NA.
