Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of tissue cassettes, which is 3 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total weight of the planing chips, which is 4g.
* `Gleason_score`: Not mentioned in the report, so it's NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report suggests subtly prostatic hyperplasia, which is a benign condition, so this is true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so it's false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so it's false.
