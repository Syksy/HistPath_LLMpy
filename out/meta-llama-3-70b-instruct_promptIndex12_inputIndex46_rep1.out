Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": 6,
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "macrosections (no specific size mentioned)",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "4+4=8 (apex), 3+4=7 (base)",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "ei",
  "6. Atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The report mentions "six macrosections" were made, so the answer is 6.
2. The report doesn't mention a specific size for the samples, only that they are "macrosections", so the answer is a description rather than a numerical value.
3. The report mentions Gleason scores of 4+4=8 for the apex and 3+4=7 for the base.
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu) in the report, so the answer is "ei".
5. There is no mention of perineural growth (perineuraalinen kasvu) in the report, and it is stated that "there is no outgrowth from the capsule", so the answer is "ei".
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "NA".
