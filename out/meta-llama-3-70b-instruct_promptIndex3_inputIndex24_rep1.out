Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 8,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "yes",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "no"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions that the samples were taken in eight blocks, so the number of samples is 8.
2. There is no information about the size of the samples, so the answer is "NA".
3. There is no mention of the Gleason score, so the answer is "NA".
4. The text states that the finding is benign, which suggests that BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) can be detected, so the answer is "yes".
5. There is no mention of perineural growth, so the answer is "NA".
6. The text does not mention atypia, and since it's a benign finding, it's likely that atypia is not present, so the answer is "no".
