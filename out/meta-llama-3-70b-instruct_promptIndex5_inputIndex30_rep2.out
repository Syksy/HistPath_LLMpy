Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "100mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient. In this case, it's not specified, so I returned `NA`.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample(s). In this case, it's specified as 100mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so I returned `NA`.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions suspicious findings for malignancy, so I set this to `false`.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly mentions perineural growth, which is a type of perineural invasion, so I set this to `true`.
* `atypia`: The report does not mention atypia or any other abnormal changes besides perineural growth and inflammatory changes, so I set this to `false`.
