Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 14, // A-D, E-F, G-N, N-O
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": 4,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 14 in this case (A-D, E-F, G-N, N-O).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the samples is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as "NA" (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The dominant Gleason score is 4, with some areas also showing Gleason score 3.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions that the tumor infiltrates the capsule and shows perineural invasion, so it's not just a benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly mentions that perineural invasion is present.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so it's marked as false.
