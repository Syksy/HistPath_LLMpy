Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 14, // A-D, E-F, G-N, N-O
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 4,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: There are 14 samples mentioned in the report: A-D, E-F, G-N, and N-O.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: No information about sample size or weight is provided in the report, so NA is returned.
* `Gleason_score`: The dominant Gleason score is 4, with some areas also showing Gleason score 3.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions cancerous growth and perineural invasion, so it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: Perineural invasion is explicitly mentioned in the report.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so NA is returned.
