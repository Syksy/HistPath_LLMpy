Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["10mm", "8mm", "14mm", "14mm"],
  "Gleason_score": "3+4=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 4 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: An array of sample sizes or weights, which are 10mm, 8mm, 14mm, and 14mm respectively.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as 3+4=7, which is a combination of the primary and secondary patterns.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report indicates that not all samples show benign hyperplasia only, so the answer is "ei" (no).
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly states that perineural invasion is not seen, so the answer is "ei" (no).
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
