Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": "(6)",
  "2. Size of the samples": "(NA)",
  "3. Gleason score": "(4+3=7)",
  "4. Presence of well-differentiated prostate cancer": "(ei)",
  "5. Presence of perineural growth": "(NA)",
  "6. Presence of atypia": "(NA)"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has 6 biopsy samples taken, as indicated by the numbers 1-6 in the report.
2. The size of the samples is not explicitly mentioned in the report, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
3. The Gleason score is 4+3=7, which indicates a moderately to poorly differentiated prostate cancer.
4. The report mentions "poorly differentiated" growth patterns, which suggests that there is no well-differentiated prostate cancer present, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
