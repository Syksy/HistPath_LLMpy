Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"sample": 1, "size": "8+6mm"},
    {"sample": 2, "size": "10mm"},
    {"sample": 3, "size": "5+5mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": [
    {"sample": 1, "score": 7},
    {"sample": 2, "score": 7}
  ],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia_present": NA
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 3.
* The size or weight of each sample is provided.
* The Gleason score is reported for samples 1 and 2, but not for sample 3 since it does not contain tumor tissue.
* Since there is no explicit mention of benign hyperplasia only, perineural invasion, or atypia in the report, these values are marked as NA (not available).
