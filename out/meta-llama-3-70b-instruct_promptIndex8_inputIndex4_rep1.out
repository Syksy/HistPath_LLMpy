Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": "koko elin yhten채 n채ytteen채",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": "NA",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "kyll채"
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: Since the report mentions that the biopsies were taken from the prostate, I assume it's a single sample (the whole prostate).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions the total length of the biopsies as approximately 150mm.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I return NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions adenocarcinoma-like morphology, so it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I return NA.
* `atypia`: The report mentions tumour-atypia, which indicates atypical changes.
