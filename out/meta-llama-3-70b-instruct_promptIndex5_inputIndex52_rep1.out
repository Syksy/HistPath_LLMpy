Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 9,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary_grade": 3,
    "secondary_grade": 4
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 9 in this case (A-C, D-E, F-G, H-I).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Since the report doesn't mention the size or weight of the samples, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as a combination of primary and secondary grades. In this case, the prevailing grades are 3 and 4, with almost equal differentiation.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). Since the report mentions a large tumor, I've marked it as false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've marked it as NA.
* `atypia`: The report doesn't mention any atypia, so I've marked it as false.
