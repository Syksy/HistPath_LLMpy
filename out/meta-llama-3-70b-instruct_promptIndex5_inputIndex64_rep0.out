I see what's going on here!

It looks like there's a syntax error in the SQL query, and the error message is not a valid histopathological report. However, I'll assume that you want me to provide a sample JSON output for a valid report.

Here's a sample JSON output for a valid histopathological report:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_amount": "0.5 cm x 0.3 cm x 0.2 cm",
  "gleason_grade": 7,
  "patient_bph": true,
  "sample_perineural_invasion": false,
  "sample_atypia": false
}
```

In this example, the report indicates that:

* 12 samples were taken from the patient.
* The sample size is 0.5 cm x 0.3 cm x 0.2 cm.
* The Gleason grade is 7.
* The patient has benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
* There is no perineural invasion.
* There is no atypia.

If any of these values are not present in the report, I would replace them with "NA" (not available). For example:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_amount": "0.5 cm x 0.3 cm x 0.2 cm",
  "gleason_grade": 7,
  "patient_bph": true,
  "sample_perineural_invasion": false,
  "sample_atypia": NA
}
```

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to help with a specific report!
