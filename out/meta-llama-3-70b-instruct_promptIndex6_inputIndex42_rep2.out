Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: 12 tissue blocks were obtained from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: No information is provided about the size or weight of the samples, so I returned NA.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason sum is 7, with the larger portion being class 3 (about 60% of the tumor).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions carcinoma, so it's not a case of only benign hyperplasia. Therefore, I returned false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I returned NA.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I returned NA.
