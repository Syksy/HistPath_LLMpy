  "d. Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu": "kyllä",
  "e. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "ei",
  "f. Atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

a. The number of samples taken is not explicitly mentioned, so the answer is "NA".

b. The total weight of the planning chips is 30g, so that's the answer.

c. There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so the answer is "NA".

d. The report mentions "suspected benign hyperplasia", which implies that there is evidence of benign prostate tissue growth, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).

e. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).

f. The report explicitly states that no atypia is visible, so the answer is "ei" (no).
