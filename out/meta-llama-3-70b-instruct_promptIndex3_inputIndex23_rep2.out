Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 3,
  "2. Size of samples": ["8+6mm", "10mm", "5+5mm"],
  "3. Gleason score": ["3+4=7", "3+4=7", "NA"],
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "yes"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 4, BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is "NA".
* For question 5, perineural growth is not explicitly mentioned, but PIN-muutoksia (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) is mentioned, which is a precursor to prostate cancer, not perineural growth. So, the answer is "NA".
* For question 6, atypia is mentioned as PIN-muutoksia, so the answer is "yes".
