Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": [
    {"Sample 1": "4+4=8"},
    {"Sample 2": "4+3=7"},
    {"Sample 3": "3+4=7"}
  ],
  "4. BPH detection": "yes",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "yes"
}
```

Note: 

* The size of the samples is not explicitly mentioned, so it's marked as "NA".
* The Gleason score is provided for three samples, and it's presented as an array of objects.
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is detected in the form of "hyperplastic changes in the epithelium", so the answer is "yes".
* There is no mention of perineural growth, so it's marked as "NA".
* Atypia is detected in the form of "atypical glandular structure", so the answer is "yes".
