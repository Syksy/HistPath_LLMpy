Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 6, because the report mentions "Samples 1-6".
* "sample_size_or_weight": NA, because the report does not provide information about the size or weight of the samples.
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention a Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": true, because the report states that "benign prostate tissue is seen" and "no carcinoma or PIN changes are found in the samples".
* "perineural_invasion": false, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": false, because the report states that "no significant atypia is observed in the gland epithelia".
