Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "5g",
  "Gleason_score": 8,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions "yhteensä noin 5g edestä prostatan höylälastuja", which implies that there is only one sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions "noin 5g", which is the weight of the sample.
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions "Gleason 4:ää ja sen eri variantteja joten pistesumma 8", which indicates a Gleason score of 8.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions "adenokarsinoomaa", which is a type of cancer, so this field is set to `false`.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are set to `NA` (Not Available) since there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the report.
