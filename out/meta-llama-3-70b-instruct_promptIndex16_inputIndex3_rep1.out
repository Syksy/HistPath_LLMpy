Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "2",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "60mm (oikea) ja 80mm (vasen)",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "4+5=9",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "ei",
  "6. Atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has two biopsy samples, one from the right side and one from the left side.
2. The lengths of the biopsy samples are approximately 60mm from the right side and 80mm from the left side.
3. The Gleason score is 4+5=9, which indicates a high-grade cancer.
4. There is no evidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the sample.
5. There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so it is assumed to be absent.
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so it is assumed to be absent.
