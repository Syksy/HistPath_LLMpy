Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. How many samples have been taken?": "4",
  "2. What is the size of the samples taken?": "10mm, 8mm, 14mm, 14mm",
  "3. What is the Gleason score of the samples?": "Gleason 3 (90%) ja Gleason 4 (10%)",
  "4. Can BPH be detected in the samples taken?": "NA",
  "5. Can perineural growth be detected in the samples taken?": "Ei",
  "6. Can atypia be detected in the samples taken?": "NA"
}
```

Note: BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is NA. Atypia is also not mentioned, so the answer is NA. Perineural growth is explicitly mentioned as not being detected, so the answer is "Ei" (Finnish for "no").
