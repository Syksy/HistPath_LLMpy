Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "approx. 150mm (total length)",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "kyllä"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions "sample 1B" and "other samples", implying that there is more than one sample, but the exact number is not specified. However, based on the context, it is likely that there is only one sample with multiple fragments (e.g., 1A, 1B, etc.). Therefore, I assume there is only 1 sample.
2. The total length of the samples is approximately 150mm.
3. The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so it is marked as "NA" (not available).
4. There is no mention of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the text, so it is marked as "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so it is marked as "NA" (not available).
6. Nuclear atypia is mentioned in the text as a morphological finding corresponding to adenocarcinoma, so it is marked as "kyllä" (yes).
