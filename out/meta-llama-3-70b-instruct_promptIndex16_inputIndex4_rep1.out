Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": ("1"),
  "2. Näytteiden koko": ("n. 150mm"),
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": ("NA"),
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("kyllä")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples taken is not explicitly stated, but since the report mentions " Näytteessä 1B", it can be inferred that there is at least one sample, and possibly more.
2. The total length of the samples is approximately 150mm.
3. There is no Gleason score mentioned in the report, so the answer is NA (not available).
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or any other type of benign growth, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. The report mentions "tuma-atypiaa" which means nuclear atypia, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
