Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient is not explicitly stated, but based on the text, it appears to be a single prostatectomy specimen, so I've assumed a value of 1.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample is not mentioned, so I've returned "NA" (not available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is explicitly stated as 7.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions a tumor, so it's not a case of benign hyperplasia only, hence the value is `false`.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion, so I've assumed it's not present, hence the value is `false`.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia, so I've assumed it's not present, hence the value is `false`.
