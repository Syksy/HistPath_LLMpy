Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 13,
  "2. Size of samples": "noin 180mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7/7/NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 3, I assumed the Gleason score is 3+4=7, as the text mentions "luokkaa 3" and "luokkaa 4" with the latter being around 30% of the tumor.
* For question 4, I answered "ei" (no) as there is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) in the text.
* For questions 5 and 6, I answered "NA" (not available) as there is no mention of perineural growth or atypia in the text.
