Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"side": "left", "size": "4mm"},
    {"side": "left", "size": "6mm"},
    {"side": "left", "size": "3mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "5mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "7mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "8mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Note: 

* The sample count is 6, as there are 6 needle samples mentioned in the report.
* The sample size or weight is reported separately for each sample, with the side (left or right) and size (in mm) specified.
* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so it is reported as NA (not available).
* The report mentions malignant growth, so it is clear that it's not just benign hyperplasia, hence the value is set to false.
* There is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the report, so these values are reported as NA.
