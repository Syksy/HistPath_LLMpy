Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 2,
  "2. Size of samples": "60mm (right), 80mm (left)",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+5=9",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "kyllä"
}
```

Note: 

* "ei" means "no" in Finnish, indicating that BPH was not detected in the samples.
* "kyllä" means "yes" in Finnish, indicating that atypia was detected in the samples (specifically, carcinoma was detected in sample B).
* "NA" means "not available" or "not applicable", indicating that perineural growth was not mentioned in the medical note.
