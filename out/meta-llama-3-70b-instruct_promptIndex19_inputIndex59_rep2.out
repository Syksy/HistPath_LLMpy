Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 3,
  "2. Size of samples": "7, 6 and 2mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* "ei" in Finnish means "no".
* "NA" means "not available" or "not mentioned" in the text.
* The Gleason score is reported as major+minor=sum, where major is the most common pattern and minor is the second most common pattern. In this case, the Gleason score is 3+4=7.
