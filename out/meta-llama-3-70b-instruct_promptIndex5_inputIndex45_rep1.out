Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Since the report doesn't mention the size or weight of the samples, we return NA (Not Available).
* `gleason_score`: Since the report doesn't mention any carcinoma or PIN changes, we return NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report states that only benign prostate tissue is seen, so we set this field to true.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report doesn't mention any perineural invasion, so we set this field to false.
* `atypia`: The report states that no significant atypia is observed, so we set this field to false.
