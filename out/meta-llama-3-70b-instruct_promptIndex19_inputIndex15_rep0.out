Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": NA,
  "3. Gleason score": NA,
  "4. BPH detection": kyllä,
  "5. Perineural growth detection": NA,
  "6. Atypia detection": ei
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions "Näytteenä 1-6 prostatabiopsiat", which means 6 prostate biopsy samples have been taken.
2. There is no information about the size of the samples in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
3. There is no mention of the Gleason score in the text, so the answer is NA.
4. The text mentions "benigniä prostatakudosta", which means benign prostate tissue, implying that BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) can be detected, so the answer is kyllä (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is NA.
6. The text mentions "ei myöskään havaita merkittävää atypiaa", which means no significant atypia was detected, so the answer is ei (no).
