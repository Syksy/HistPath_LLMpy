Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "no"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text states that there are 6 samples taken.
2. The size of the samples is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as "NA" (not available).
3. The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as "NA".
4. BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not explicitly mentioned in the text, so it's marked as "NA".
5. Perineural growth is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as "NA".
6. The text states that no significant atypia is observed, so it's marked as "no".
