Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"side": "left", "size": "10 mm"},
    {"side": "left", "size": "7 mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "15 mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "10 mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": {"primary": 3, "secondary": 4},
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 4 in this case (2 from the left side and 2 from the right side).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: An array of objects describing the size of each sample. Since the weight is not mentioned, I assumed the values are lengths in mm.
* `Gleason_score`: An object with the primary and secondary Gleason scores, which are 3 and 4, respectively.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia. In this case, it's false because malignant cells are present.
* `perineural_invasion`: A boolean indicating whether perineural invasion is present. In this case, it's true because growth around nerves is mentioned.
* `atypia`: Since there is no mention of atypia in the original report, I returned NA (Not Available) for this field.
