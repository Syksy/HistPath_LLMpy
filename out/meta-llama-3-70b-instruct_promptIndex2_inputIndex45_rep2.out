Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("6"),
  "2. Sample size": ("NA"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("NA"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("kyllä"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Note: 

* For question 2, the sample size is not mentioned in the report, so I answered "NA" (not available).
* For question 3, the Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so I answered "NA" (not available).
* For question 4, the report mentions that benign prostate tissue is seen, which implies that there is benign prostatic hyperplasia, so I answered "kyllä" (yes).
* For question 5, there is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so I answered "ei" (no).
* For question 6, the report explicitly states that no significant atypia is observed, so I answered "ei" (no).
