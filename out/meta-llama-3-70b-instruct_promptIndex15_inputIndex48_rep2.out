Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("6"),
  "2. Sample size": ("4mm", "6mm", "3mm", "5mm", "7mm", "8mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("NA"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has 6 samples in total (3 from the left and 3 from the right).
2. The sample sizes are 4mm, 6mm, 3mm, 5mm, 7mm, and 8mm.
3. There is no Gleason score mentioned in the report, so the answer is NA (not available).
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
