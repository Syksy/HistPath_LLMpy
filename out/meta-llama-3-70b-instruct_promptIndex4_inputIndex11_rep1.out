Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 13,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "180mm",
  "Gleason_score": "3+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of biopsy samples taken from the patient, which is 13 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the biopsy material, which is approximately 180mm in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the tumor, which is 3+4 in this case, indicating that the majority of the tumor is grade 3 and a smaller portion is grade 4 (approximately 30%).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, the answer is false, since cancer was detected in five of the biopsy samples.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields were not mentioned in the original report, so I returned NA (Not Available) for both.
