Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "NA",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "3+4=7",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "ei",
  "6. Atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. Näytteiden määrä: There is no clear mention of the number of samples taken from the patient, so the answer is "NA".
2. Näytteiden koko: There is no clear mention of the size of the samples, so the answer is "NA".
3. Gleason-luokitus: The Gleason score is mentioned as "Gleason level 7 carcinoma, of which a larger proportion with a score of 3, approx. 60% of the findings", which can be interpreted as 3+4=7.
4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu: There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia, and the report focuses on the tumor, so the answer is "ei".
5. Perineuraalinen kasvu: There is no mention of perineural growth, and the report states that "Overgrowth is not seen", which implies that there is no perineural growth, so the answer is "ei".
6. Atypia: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "NA".
