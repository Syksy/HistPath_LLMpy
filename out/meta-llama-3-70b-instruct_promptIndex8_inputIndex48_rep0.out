Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4+6+3mm, 5+7+8mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: 6, because there are 6 samples mentioned in the report (3 from the left and 3 from the right).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the samples are given in millimeters, so I reported them as such.
* `Gleason_score`: Not mentioned in the report, so I returned NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Not mentioned in the report, so I returned NA.
* `perineural_invasion`: Not mentioned in the report, so I returned NA.
* `atypia`: Not mentioned in the report, so I returned NA.
