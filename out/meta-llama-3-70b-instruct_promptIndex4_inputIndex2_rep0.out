Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "90mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: 3, as there are 3 prostate biopsy samples.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: "90mm", as the total length of the samples is 90mm.
* `Gleason_score`: NA, as there is no mention of Gleason score in the report.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: true, as the report suggests that one of the samples may indicate hyperplasia, and there is no mention of malignant findings.
* `perineural_invasion`: false, as there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: false, as the report explicitly states that there is no atypia or malignant findings.
