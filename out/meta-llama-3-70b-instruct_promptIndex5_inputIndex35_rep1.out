Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "5g",
  "Gleason_score": 8,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Since the report mentions "prostate shavings" (plural), I assume it's a single sample with multiple shavings. If it were multiple separate samples, the report would likely mention the number of samples.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions "about 5g" of prostate shavings.
* `Gleason_score`: The report states that the most representative Gleason score is 4, and the total score is 8.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a type of cancer, so this field is set to `false`.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so this field is set to `false`.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so this field is set to `false`.
