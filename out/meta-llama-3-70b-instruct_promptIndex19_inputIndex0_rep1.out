Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "100mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "yes",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions "näyte" which is singular, indicating that only one sample has been taken.
2. The size of the sample is 100mm, as mentioned in the text.
3. There is no mention of the Gleason score in the text, so it's marked as NA (not available).
4. There is no mention of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the text, so it's marked as "ei" (no).
5. The text explicitly mentions "perineuraalia kasvua" which means perineural growth, so it's marked as "yes".
6. The text mentions "ei selkeää malignia tai PIN löydöstä" which means no clear malignancy or PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) was found, so atypia detection is marked as "ei" (no).
