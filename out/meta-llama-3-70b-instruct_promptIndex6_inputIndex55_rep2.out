Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "approximately 2mm",
  "Gleason_score": 4,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions "Samples 1-4", so there are 4 samples in total.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions an "approximately 2mm area" of adenocarcinoma, which I assume refers to the size of the sample.
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions that the most prevalent Gleason grade is 4, although grade 3 is also present.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor, so this field is set to false.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are set to NA (Not Available) since there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the report.
