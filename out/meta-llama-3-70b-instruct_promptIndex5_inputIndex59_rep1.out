Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30mm",
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 3 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total length of the biopsies, which is 30mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the carcinoma, which is 7 (with a mix of grade 3 and grade 4 architecture).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, it's false because carcinoma foci were found.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field indicates whether perineural invasion (i.e., cancer growth around nerves) was observed. In this case, it's false because there's no mention of it in the report.
* `atypia`: This field indicates whether atypical changes (i.e., abnormal cell growth) were observed. In this case, it's false because there's no mention of it in the report.
