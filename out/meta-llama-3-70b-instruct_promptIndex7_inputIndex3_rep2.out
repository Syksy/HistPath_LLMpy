Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 2,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "60mm (right), 80mm (left)",
  "Gleason_score": 9,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 2, because there are two biopsy samples mentioned (right and left).
* "sample_size_or_weight": "60mm (right), 80mm (left)", because the sizes of the samples are given in millimeters.
* "Gleason_score": 9, because the Gleason score is explicitly mentioned as 9 (4+5).
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions carcinoma, which is a malignant tumor.
* "perineural_invasion" and "atypia": NA, because there is no mention of these features in the report.
