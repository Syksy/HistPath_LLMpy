Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("9"),
  "2. Sample size": ("macrosections"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("3+4=7/7/NA"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples is 9, which includes 2 macrosections from the apex (A-C), 2 from the base (D-E), 2 from the base (F-G), 2 from the seminal vesicles (H-I), and 1 from the marked border of the edge.
2. The sample size is described as macrosections, which are larger sections of tissue taken from the prostate.
3. The Gleason score is 3+4=7, indicating that the tumor has a mix of Gleason grade 3 and grade 4 differentiation, with the prevailing grade being almost equal between the two.
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
