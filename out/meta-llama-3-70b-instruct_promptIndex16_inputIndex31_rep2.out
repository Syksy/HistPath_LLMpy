2. The size of the samples is not specified in the report, so the answer is NA (Not Available).
3. The Gleason score is 3+4=7, which indicates a moderate to high-grade tumor.
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or any other type of benign growth in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. The report explicitly states that there is no perineural invasion, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is NA (Not Available).
