Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 8,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 8, as mentioned in the text ("in eight blocks").
* The size of samples is not mentioned in the text, so it's "NA" (not available).
* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so it's "NA".
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) detection is not mentioned in the text, so it's "NA".
* Perineural growth detection is not mentioned in the text, so it's "NA".
* Atypia detection is "ei" (no), as the text states that the finding is benign.
