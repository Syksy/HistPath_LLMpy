Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Not mentioned in the report, so NA (Not Available) is returned.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions that the total weight of the tissue fragments is approximately 30g.
* `Gleason_score`: Not mentioned in the report, so NA is returned.
* `benign_hyperplasia`: The report concludes that the finding is consistent with benign hyperplasia, so this field is set to true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so this field is set to false.
* `atypia`: The report explicitly states that there is no atypia, so this field is set to false.
