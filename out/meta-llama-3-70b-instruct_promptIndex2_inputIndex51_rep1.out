Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("4"),
  "2. Sample size": ("4g"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("NA"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("kyll√§"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("NA"),
  "6. Atypia": ("NA")
}
```

Note: The Gleason score, perineural growth, and atypia are not mentioned in the given report, so I've marked them as "NA" (not available).
