Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 4,
  "2. Size of samples": "10mm, 7mm, 15mm, 10mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "yes",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 4, as there are two fragments from the left side and two from the right side.
* The sizes of the samples are 10mm, 7mm, 15mm, and 10mm.
* The Gleason score is 3+4, as the major pattern is 3 and the minor pattern is 4.
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is 'NA'.
* Perineural growth is mentioned in the text, so the answer is 'yes'.
* Atypia is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is 'NA'.
