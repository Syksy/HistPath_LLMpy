I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text does not contain any relevant information about the biopsy sample or the patient's condition. The text appears to be a mix of random words and phrases, including "Lorem ipsum", mathematical expressions, and Finnish words.

As a result, I'm unable to provide answers to the questions based on the provided text. If you could provide the actual biopsy report or a relevant text, I'd be happy to assist you in extracting the necessary information.

Here is the response in JSON format, with "NA" indicating that the information is not available:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "NA",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "NA",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "NA"
}
```

Please provide the actual biopsy report, and I'll do my best to assist you in extracting the necessary information.
