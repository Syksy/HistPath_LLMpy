Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["10mm", "8mm", "14mm", "14mm"],
  "Gleason_score": "3+4=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Let me explain how I arrived at this structured report:

* `sample_count`: There are 4 biopsy samples mentioned in the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of each sample are listed in millimeters.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as a combination of two scores, 3 and 4, with a total sum of 7.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since the report mentions adenocarcinoma in one of the samples, this field is set to "ei" (no).
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly states that perineural invasion is not seen in any of the samples, so this field is set to "ei" (no).
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so this field is set to "NA" (not available).
