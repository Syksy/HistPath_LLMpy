Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "100mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Since the report doesn't explicitly mention the number of samples, I assume it's 1.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions the total length of the sample as 100mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The report doesn't provide a Gleason score, so I return NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions suspect malignancy, so it's not a case of only benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly mentions perineural growth, which is a type of perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: The report doesn't mention atypia or any changes deviating from normal tissue, so I return false.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
