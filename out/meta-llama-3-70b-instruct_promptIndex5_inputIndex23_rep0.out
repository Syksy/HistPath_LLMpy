Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "samples": [
    {
      "sample_id": 1,
      "number_of_samples": 2,
      "size_or_weight": "8+6mm",
      "gleason_score": 7,
      "gleason_breakdown": {
        "3": 60,
        "4": 40
      },
      "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
      "perineural_invasion": NA,
      "atypia": true
    },
    {
      "sample_id": 2,
      "number_of_samples": 1,
      "size_or_weight": "10mm",
      "gleason_score": 7,
      "gleason_breakdown": {
        "3": 70,
        "4": 30
      },
      "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
      "perineural_invasion": NA,
      "atypia": true
    },
    {
      "sample_id": 3,
      "number_of_samples": 2,
      "size_or_weight": "5+5mm",
      "gleason_score": NA,
      "gleason_breakdown": NA,
      "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
      "perineural_invasion": NA,
      "atypia": false
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: I assumed that the PIN-muutoksia mentioned in the report refers to atypia, and therefore marked it as true for samples 1 and 2. If this is not correct, please let me know. Also, since there was no mention of perineural invasion in the report, I marked it as NA (not available) for all samples.
