Here are the answers to the questions based on the histopathological report:

{
"(Näytteiden määrä)": 6,
"(Näytteiden koko)": ["8mm", "5mm"],
"(Gleason-luokitus)": ["4+4", "3+4"],
"(Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu)": "ei",
"(Perineuraalinen kasvu)": "ei",
"(Atypia)": "NA"
}

Note: For question 2, I provided both sizes mentioned in the report as an array, as there are two different sizes mentioned. For question 3, I provided both Gleason scores mentioned in the report as an array, as there are two different scores mentioned. For question 4, I answered "ei" (no) because the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor, not a benign hyperplasia. For question 5, I answered "ei" (no) because there is no mention of perineural growth in the report. For question 6, I answered "NA" (not available) because there is no mention of atypia in the report.
