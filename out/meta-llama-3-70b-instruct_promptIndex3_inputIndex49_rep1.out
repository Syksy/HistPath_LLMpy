Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": "1",
  "2. Size of samples": "12.3g",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "yes",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is assumed to be 1 since the text does not explicitly mention multiple samples.
* The size of the samples is 12.3g as mentioned in the text.
* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so it is marked as "NA".
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) can be detected in the samples taken since the text mentions "stromal hyperplasia", which is a characteristic of BPH.
* Perineural growth and atypia are not mentioned in the text, so they are marked as "NA".
