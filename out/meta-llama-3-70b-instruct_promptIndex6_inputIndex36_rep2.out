Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12, // assuming 12 samples based on the mention of specimens D-G and K-P
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA, // no information available
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, // since carcinoma is mentioned
  "perineural_invasion": NA, // no information available
  "atypia": NA // no information available
}
```

Note that I had to make an assumption about the number of samples based on the mention of specimens D-G and K-P, but this may not be entirely accurate. Additionally, there was no information available regarding sample size or weight, perineural invasion, or atypia, so I returned NA for those fields.
