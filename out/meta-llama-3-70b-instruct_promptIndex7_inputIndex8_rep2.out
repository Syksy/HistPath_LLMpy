Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 6, because the report mentions that 20g of tissue was divided into 6 blocks.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "30g", because the report mentions that the total weight of the tissue was approximately 30g.
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention the Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": true, because the report concludes that the finding is consistent with benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": false, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": false, because the report explicitly states that no atypia was found.
