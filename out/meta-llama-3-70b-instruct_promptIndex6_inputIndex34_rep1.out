Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "approx. 150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions multiple samples, but it's not clear how many. However, it's clear that at least one sample (1B) has abnormal findings. Therefore, I've set this value to 1.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions the total length of the samples as approximately 150mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The report does not mention the Gleason score, so I've set this value to NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions adenocarcinoma in sample 1B, which indicates that it's not just benign hyperplasia. Therefore, I've set this value to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report does not mention perineural invasion, so I've set this value to NA (Not Available).
* `atypia`: The report mentions nuclear atypia in sample 1B, which indicates that atypia is present. Therefore, I've set this value to true.
