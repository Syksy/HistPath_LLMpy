Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30mm",
  "Gleason_score": "7 (3+4)",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: 3, because there are three fusion biopsies.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: "30mm", because the total length of the biopsies is 30mm.
* `Gleason_score`: "7 (3+4)", because the Gleason score is 7, with a major component of 3 and a minor component of 4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei", because the report mentions carcinoma foci, indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: both are "NA", because there is no mention of these features in the report.
