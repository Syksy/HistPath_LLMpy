Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30mm",
  "Gleason_score": "7 (3+4)",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "kyllä"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: 3, since there are three fusion biopsies.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: 30mm, which is the total length of the biopsies.
* `Gleason_score`: 7 (3+4), which is the Gleason score mentioned in the report.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei", since the report mentions carcinoma foci, indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: "ei", since there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: "kyllä", since the report mentions Gleason type 4 spliced structure, which indicates atypia.
