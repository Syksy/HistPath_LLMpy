Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "kyllä",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: 6, because the report mentions 1-6 prostate biopsies.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, because the report does not provide information about the size or weight of the samples.
* `Gleason_score`: NA, because the report does not mention the Gleason score.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "kyllä", because the report states that only benign prostate tissue is seen in the samples.
* `perineural_invasion`: "ei", because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: "ei", because the report states that no significant atypia is seen in the samples.
