Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```

  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: 12, as there are 12 tissue blocks obtained from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, as the size or weight of the samples is not mentioned in the report.
