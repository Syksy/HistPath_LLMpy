Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 12 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the samples is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is 7, which is mentioned in the report.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions that the growth is not only benign hyperplasia, so this field is set to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so it's marked as NA.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so it's marked as NA.
