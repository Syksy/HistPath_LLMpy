Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 14,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 4/3,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: 14, as there are 14 samples mentioned in the report (A-D, E-F, G-N, and N-O).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, as there is no information about the size or weight of the samples.
* `Gleason_score`: 4/3, as the prevailing Gleason class is 4, and there is also some class 3.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: false, as the report mentions a tumor that infiltrates through the capsule into the fat, indicating malignant growth.
* `perineural_invasion`: true, as perineural invasion is abundantly observed.
* `atypia`: NA, as there is no mention of atypia in the report.
