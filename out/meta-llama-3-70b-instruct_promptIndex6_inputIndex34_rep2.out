Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "approx. 150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions multiple samples (e.g., "In sample 1B"), but it's not clear how many samples were taken in total. Based on the text, I assume there is at least one sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report provides an approximate length of the sample, which is 150mm.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of the Gleason score in the report, so I return NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report suggests that most samples show normal glandular tissue, indicating benign hyperplasia. However, there is a focus with adenocarcinoma features in sample 1B. Since this is not the dominant feature, I set this field to true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I set this field to false.
* `atypia`: The report mentions nuclear atypia in sample 1B, so I set this field to true.

Please note that some fields may require additional information or clarification from the original report or the pathologist who wrote it.
