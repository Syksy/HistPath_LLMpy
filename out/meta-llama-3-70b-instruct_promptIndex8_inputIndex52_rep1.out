Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 9, 
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA, 
  "Gleason_score": "3+4", 
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei", 
  "perineural_invasion": NA, 
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 9, because there are 9 samples mentioned in the report (A-C, D-E, F-G, H-I).
* "sample_size_or_weight": NA, because the report does not provide information about the size or weight of the samples.
* "Gleason_score": "3+4", because the report mentions that the prevailing Gleason grade 3 and grade 4 differentiation is almost equal.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei", because the report mentions a large tumor, which indicates that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": NA, because the report does not mention atypia.
