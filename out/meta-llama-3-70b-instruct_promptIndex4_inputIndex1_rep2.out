Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```

  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: 6, as there are 6 formalin-fixed samples mentioned in the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, as there is no mention of the size or weight of the samples in the report.
