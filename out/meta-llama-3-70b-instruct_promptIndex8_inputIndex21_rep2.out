Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,  // (assuming the 4g of tissue is one sample)
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": "kyllä",
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Note: Since the original report does not mention the Gleason score, perineural invasion, or atypia, I have marked them as NA (Not Available). The report does suggest benign hyperplasia, so I have marked that as "kyllä" (yes).
