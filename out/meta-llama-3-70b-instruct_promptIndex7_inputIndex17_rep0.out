Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["10mm", "7mm", "15mm", "10mm"],
  "Gleason_score": 3,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: 4, since there are 4 fragments mentioned in the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: An array of sizes, since there are multiple fragments with different sizes.
* `Gleason_score`: 3, since it's mentioned as the primary pattern in the report.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: false, since the report mentions malignant cells and perineural invasion.
* `perineural_invasion`: true, since it's explicitly mentioned in the report.
* `atypia`: true, since the report mentions "matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa", which implies atypical cells.
