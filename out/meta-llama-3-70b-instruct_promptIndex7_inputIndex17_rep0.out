Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["10mm", "7mm", "15mm", "10mm"],
  "Gleason_score": 3,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as 3, with a secondary pattern of 4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This is set to false because the report mentions malignant growth patterns.
