I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text does not seem to be a real histopathological prostate cancer sample statement in Finnish. The text appears to be a mix of Latin phrases, mathematical expressions, and Finnish words.

If you could provide a real histopathological prostate cancer sample statement in Finnish, I would be happy to assist you in extracting the required information.

For now, I'll provide a response based on the assumption that the text is not a real sample statement. Here is the answer in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": "NA",
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Please provide a real sample statement, and I'll do my best to extract the required information.
