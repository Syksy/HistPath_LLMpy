I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text does not seem to be a real histopathological prostate cancer sample statement in Finnish. The text appears to be a mix of Latin phrases and Finnish numbers.

If you could provide a real sample statement, I'd be happy to assist you in extracting the information. Please note that I'll do my best to provide the answers based on the instructions, but I may need clarification or additional context if the text is unclear or incomplete.

For now, I'll provide a response in JSON format with 'NA' (Not Available) for all questions since the provided text does not contain relevant information:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": "NA",
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Please provide a real sample statement, and I'll do my best to extract the necessary information.
