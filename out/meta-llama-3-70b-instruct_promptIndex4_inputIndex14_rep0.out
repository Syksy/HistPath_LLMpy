Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"sample": 1, "size_or_weight": "10mm"},
    {"sample": 2, "size_or_weight": "8mm"},
    {"sample": 3, "size_or_weight": "14mm"},
    {"sample": 4, "size_or_weight": "14mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary_pattern": 3,
    "secondary_pattern": 4,
    "percentage_primary_pattern": 90,
    "percentage_secondary_pattern": 10
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia_present": NA
}
```

Note: I assumed that the Gleason score is reported as a primary and secondary pattern with corresponding percentages. If this is not the case, please let me know and I'll adjust the output accordingly. Also, since there was no mention of atypia in the original report, I returned NA for that field.
