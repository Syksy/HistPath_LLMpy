Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": ["5mm", "10mm", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA"],
  "3. Gleason score": ["4+4=8", "4+3=7", "3+4=7", "NA", "NA", "NA"],
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "kyllä"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 2, the sizes are only mentioned for samples 1 and 2, so the rest are marked as "NA" (not available).
* For question 3, the Gleason scores are only mentioned for samples 1, 2, and 3, so the rest are marked as "NA".
