Based on the provided text, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the result:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

As you can see, all the values are marked as NA (Not Available) because the provided text does not contain any specific information about the patient's biopsy results, Gleason score, or other relevant details. The text appears to be a general information article about prostate cancer, rather than a specific pathology report.
