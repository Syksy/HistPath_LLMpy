Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "a. Näytteiden määrä": 6,
  "b. Näytteiden koko": [4, 6, 3, 5, 7, 8],
  "c. Gleason-luokitus": NA,
  "d. Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu": ei,
  "e. Perineuraalinen kasvu": NA,
  "f. Atypia": NA
}
```

Note: 

* For question a, the number of samples is 6 (4+6+3 from the left and 5+7+8 from the right).
* For question b, the sizes of the samples are listed as an array.
* For question c, there is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so the answer is NA.
* For questions d-f, since there is no clear indication of good-quality prostate hyperplasia, perineural growth, or atypia in the report, the answers are 'ei' (no) for d and NA for e and f.
