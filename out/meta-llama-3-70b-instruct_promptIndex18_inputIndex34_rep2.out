Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": "multiple",
  "2. Size of samples": "150mm (total length)",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "kyll√§"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 1, the answer is "multiple" because the text mentions "sample 1B" and "other samples", implying that there are multiple samples, but the exact number is not specified.
* For question 3, the answer is "NA" because the Gleason score is not mentioned in the text.
* For question 4, the answer is "ei" because the text does not mention BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia).
* For question 5, the answer is "NA" because the text does not mention perineural growth.
