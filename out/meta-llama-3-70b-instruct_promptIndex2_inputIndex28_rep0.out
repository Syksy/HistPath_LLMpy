Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "(6)",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "(<1mm)",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "(4+3=7)",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "('ei')",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "('NA')",
  "6. Atypia": "('NA')"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has 6 biopsy samples taken.
2. The size of the samples is less than 1mm.
3. The Gleason score is 4+3=7, which indicates a moderately differentiated tumor.
4. There is no evidence of well-differentiated prostate cancer (i.e., 'ei' means 'no' in Finnish).
5. There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so the answer is 'NA' (not available).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is 'NA' (not available).
