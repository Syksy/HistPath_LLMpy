  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "(4+3=7)",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "(ei)",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "(NA)",

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has 6 biopsy samples taken.
2. The size of the samples is less than 1mm.
3. The Gleason score is 4+3=7.
4. There is no well-differentiated prostate cancer growth (i.e., Gleason 5 is a high-grade cancer, and Gleason 4+3=7 is an intermediate-grade cancer).
5. There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so the answer is NA (not available).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is NA (not available).
