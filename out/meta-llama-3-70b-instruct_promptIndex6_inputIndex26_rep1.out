Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 12 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total length of the samples, which is approximately 150mm.
* `Gleason_score`: Since the Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Based on the report, it seems that the growth is benign and only shows hyperplastic changes, so I've marked this as true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've marked this as false.
* `atypia`: Similarly, there is no mention of atypia or any abnormal changes in the report, so I've marked this as false.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!
