Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "100mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia_present": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Since there is no explicit mention of multiple samples, I assume only one sample was taken.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions the total length of the sample as 100mm.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I return NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions suspect malignancy and perineural growth, which suggests that it's not just benign hyperplasia, so I set this to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly mentions perineural growth, which is a type of perineural invasion, so I set this to true.
* `atypia_present`: There is no mention of atypia or any abnormal changes in the report, so I set this to false.

Please note that if any information is missing or unclear from the report, I will return NA as per your instructions.
