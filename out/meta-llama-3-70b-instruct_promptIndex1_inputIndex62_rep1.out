I'll go through the questions one by one and provide the answers in JSON format.

**1. Näytteiden määrä:**
Since the text is a misleading sentence, there is no mention of the number of samples taken from the patient. Therefore, the answer is:
```
{
  "näytteiden_määrä": "NA"
}
```

Please let me know when to proceed to the next question!
