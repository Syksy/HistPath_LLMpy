Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 12,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "7 (3+4)",
  "4. BPH detection": "yes",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The size of the samples is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as "NA" (Not Available).
* The Gleason score is mentioned as 7, and the major part is class 3, which is around 60% of the tumor. Assuming the minor part is class 4, the Gleason score can be written as 7 (3+4).
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) can be detected in the samples taken, as the text mentions "rauhasrakennetta" which translates to "glandular structure", indicating the presence of BPH.
* There is no mention of perineural growth or atypia in the text, so they are marked as "NA".
