Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 4,
  "2. Size of samples": ["10mm", "8mm", "14mm", "14mm"],
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "no",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "no",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 4, I assumed that BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not detected since the sample 4 shows adenocarcinoma and no mention of BPH.
* For question 6, I answered 'NA' since there is no mention of atypia in the given text.
