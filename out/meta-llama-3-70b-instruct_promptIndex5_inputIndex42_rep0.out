Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of tissue blocks obtained from the shavings, which is 12 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason sum is 7, which is a measure of the aggressiveness of the cancer.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: False, because the report mentions carcinoma (cancer) in a small part of the chips.
* `perineural_invasion`: Not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
* `atypia`: Not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
