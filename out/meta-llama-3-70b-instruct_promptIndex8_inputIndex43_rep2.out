Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": "NA",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "19g",
  "Gleason_score": "5+4=9",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: Since the text doesn't explicitly mention the number of samples, I returned `NA`.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The text mentions "About 19g of prostate shavings in total", so I returned `19g`.
* `Gleason_score`: The text mentions "the highest level 5 and the second highest level 4 in the Gleason classification", so I returned `5+4=9`.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The text describes a "carpet-like malignant growth", which implies that it's not just benign hyperplasia, so I returned `ei` (no).
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These are not mentioned in the text, so I returned `NA` for both.
