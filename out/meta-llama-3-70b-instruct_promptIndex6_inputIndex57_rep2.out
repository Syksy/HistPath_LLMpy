Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["8mm", "7mm", "5mm"],
  "Gleason_score": 3,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 12 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the biopsies, which are 8mm, 7mm, and 5mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the carcinoma, which is 3 in this case.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no carcinoma). In this case, it's false because carcinoma was found.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field indicates whether perineural invasion (i.e., cancer cells invading the nerves) is present. Since it's not mentioned in the report, the value is NA (not available).
* `atypia`: This field indicates whether atypia (i.e., abnormal cell changes) is present. In this case, it's false because the report states that no nuclear atypia is observed.
