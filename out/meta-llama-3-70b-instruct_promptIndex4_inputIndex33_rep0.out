Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 2,
  "sample_size_or_weight": {"right": "60mm", "left": "80mm"},
  "Gleason_score": 9,
  "Gleason_breakdown": {"primary": 4, "secondary": 5},
  "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: 2, as there are biopsies taken from two sites (right and left).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size of each sample is reported in millimeters.
* `Gleason_score`: The total Gleason score is 9.
* `Gleason_breakdown`: The primary and secondary Gleason scores are 4 and 5, respectively.
* `benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only`: False, as a carcinoma is found in sample B.
* `perineural_invasion`: NA, as there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: False, as there is no mention of atypia in the report.
