Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia": true,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions that the samples were launched into three tissue cassettes, so I assume there are 3 samples.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report states that the total weight of the samples is 4g.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I return NA (Not Available).
* `benign_prostatic_hyperplasia`: The report suggests subtly prostatic hyperplasia, which is a benign condition, so I set this field to true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I return NA.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I return NA.

Please note that the report is quite brief, and some information might be missing. If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask!
