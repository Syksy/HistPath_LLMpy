Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions that the samples were launched into three tissue cassettes, so I assume there are three samples.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report states that the total weight of the planing chips is 4g.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I return NA (Not Available).
* `benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only`: The report suggests subtly prostatic hyperplasia, which implies that only benign prostatic hyperplasia is present.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I assume it's not present and return false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia or any abnormal changes in the report, so I return false.

Please note that if any information is missing or unclear in the report, I will return NA or make an educated assumption based on the context.
