Here are the answers to the questions based on the provided histopathological report:

{
"(Näytteiden määrä)": 9,
"(Näytteiden koko)": NA,
"(Gleason-luokitus)": 3-4,
"(Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu)": NA,
"(Perineuraalinen kasvu)": NA,
"(Atypia)": NA
}

Note: The number of samples is 9, as there are 3 apex samples (A-C), 2 macro samples from the base (D-E), 2 samples from the base (F-G), and 2 samples from the seminal vesicles (H-I). The size of the samples is not specified in the report, so the answer is NA. The Gleason score is 3-4, as the dominant pattern is Gleason 3 and there is almost an equal amount of Gleason 4 differentiation. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia, perineural invasion, or atypia in the report, so the answers to these questions are NA.
