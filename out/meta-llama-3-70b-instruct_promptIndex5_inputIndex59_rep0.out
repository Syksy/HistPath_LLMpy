Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size": "30mm",
  "gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 3 in this case.
* `sample_size`: The total length of the biopsies, which is 30mm.
* `gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the carcinoma, which is 7 (3+4).
* `benign_hyperplasia`: This field indicates whether the sample shows only benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, it's false because the sample shows carcinoma.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field indicates whether the sample shows perineural invasion (i.e., cancer growth around nerves). In this case, it's false because there's no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: This field indicates whether the sample shows atypia (i.e., abnormal cell changes). In this case, it's false because there's no mention of atypia in the report.
