Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "4+6+3 mm, 5+7+8 mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "yes"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 6 (4+6+3 from the left and 5+7+8 from the right).
* The size of the samples is given as two separate measurements: 4+6+3 mm and 5+7+8 mm.
* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as "NA".
* There is no mention of BPH or perineural growth in the text, so they are marked as "NA".
* Atypia is implied by the phrase "maligniin viittaavaa kasvua" which translates to "growth suggestive of malignancy", so it's marked as "yes".
