Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "90mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": "kyllä",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Note: I assumed that the presence of hyperplasia-like features in one of the samples indicates benign hyperplasia, but this might not be a definitive conclusion. If you want to be more cautious, you could replace "kyllä" with "NA" for this field.
