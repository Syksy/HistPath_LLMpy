Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 6, because the report mentions "Kuusi formaliinifiksoitua preparaattia", which means six formalin-fixed samples.
* "sample_size_or_weight": NA, because the report does not provide information about the size or weight of the samples.
* "Gleason_score": 7, because the report mentions "Gleason-luokkaa 3 (noin 60%), loput luokkaa 4, siis 3+4=7".
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions Gleason score and invasive growth, indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": false, because the report explicitly states "eikä vesikkeli- tai perineuraali-invaasiota", which means no perineural invasion.
* "atypia": NA, because the report does not provide information about atypia.
