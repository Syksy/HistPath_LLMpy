Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["8mm", "7mm", "5mm"],
  "Gleason_score": 3,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 12, because the report mentions 12 biopsies in total.
* "sample_size_or_weight": ["8mm", "7mm", "5mm"], because the report mentions the size of three biopsies.
* "Gleason_score": 3, because the report mentions Gleason 3 architecture in multiple biopsies.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions adenocarcinoma in multiple biopsies.
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": false, because the report explicitly states that no atypia was found.
