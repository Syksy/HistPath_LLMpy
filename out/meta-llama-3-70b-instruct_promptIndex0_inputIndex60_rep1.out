I apologize, but the provided text "Beep boop? Boop biip. Blarp!" does not appear to be a medical report or a doctor's statement about a prostate cancer sample. It seems to be a nonsensical sequence of words.

As a result, I cannot provide answers to the questions based on this text. If you could provide an actual medical report or doctor's statement, I would be happy to help you analyze it and answer your questions.

Here is the response in JSON format:

{
"a": "NA",
"b": "NA",
"c": "NA",
"d": "NA",
"e": "NA",
"f": "NA"
}
