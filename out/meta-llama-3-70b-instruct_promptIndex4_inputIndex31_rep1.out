Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: 6, as mentioned in the report ("Six formalin-fixed preparations").
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, as the report does not provide information on the size or weight of the samples.
* `Gleason_score`: 7, calculated from the report as 3+4=7.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: false, as the report mentions Gleason classes 3 and 4, indicating malignant growth.
* `perineural_invasion`: false, as the report explicitly states "no perineural invasion".
* `atypia`: NA, as the report does not mention atypia or any other term related to abnormal cellular changes.
