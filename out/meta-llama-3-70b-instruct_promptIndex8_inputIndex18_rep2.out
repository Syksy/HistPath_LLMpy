Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4+6+3 mm, 5+7+8 mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: 6, because there are 6 biopsy samples mentioned in the report (4+6+3 from the left and 5+7+8 from the right).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the samples are mentioned in millimeters, so I've kept them as is.
* `Gleason_score`: Not mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei" (no), because the report mentions malignant growth and adenocarcinoma suspicion.
* `perineural_invasion`: Not mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as NA.
* `atypia`: Not mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as NA.
