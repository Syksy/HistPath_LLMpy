I think there may be a problem here...

It seems that the text you provided is not a histopathological report, but rather a passage from a science fiction novel or a poem. There is no relevant information about a patient's biopsy or tissue sample.

As a result, I will have to return a JSON object with all values set to "NA" (Not Available), indicating that the requested information is not present in the text.

Here is the JSON response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": "NA",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": "NA",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "NA",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

If you could provide a real histopathological report, I would be happy to help you extract the relevant information and convert it into a structured format.
