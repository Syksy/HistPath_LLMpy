Here are the answers to the questions based on the provided histopathological report:

```
{
  "Näytteiden määrä": 4,
  "Näytteiden koko": [10, 8, 14, 14],
  "Gleason-luokitus": [3, 4],
  "Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "Perineuraalinen kasvu": "ei",
  "Atypia": "NA"
}
```

Note: For question 2, I provided a list of sizes since there are multiple samples with different sizes. For question 3, I provided a list of Gleason scores since there are two different scores mentioned in the report. For question 6, I answered "NA" since there is no mention of atypia in the report.
