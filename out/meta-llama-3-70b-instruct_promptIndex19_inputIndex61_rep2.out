I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text does not appear to be a legitimate medical note written by a histopathologist in Finnish. The text seems to be a mix of nonsensical phrases and mathematical operations.

As a result, I will not be able to extract any meaningful information from the text. Here is the response in JSON format:

{
"1. Number of samples": NA,
"2. Size of samples": NA,
"3. Gleason score": NA,
"4. BPH detection": NA,
"5. Perineural growth detection": NA,
"6. Atypia detection": NA
}

Please provide a legitimate medical note in Finnish, and I will do my best to extract the necessary information.
