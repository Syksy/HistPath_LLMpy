I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text does not appear to be a medical report or a histopathological description of a prostate cancer sample. The text seems to be a passage from a science fiction novel or a poem.

If you could provide the actual medical report or histopathological description, I would be happy to assist you in extracting the requested information.

For now, I will respond with "NA" (Not Available) for each question, as there is no relevant information in the provided text.

Here is the response in JSON format:

```
{
  "Näytteiden määrä": "NA",
  "Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "NA",
  "Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "Atypia": "NA"
}
```

Please provide the actual medical report, and I'll be happy to assist you in extracting the requested information.
