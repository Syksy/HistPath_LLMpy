Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("4"),
  "2. Sample size": ("10mm, 8mm, 14mm, 14mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("3+4=7"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural invasion": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("NA")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has 4 samples taken.
2. The sizes of the samples are 10mm, 8mm, 14mm, and 14mm.
3. The Gleason score is 3+4=7, with 90% of the glands forming Gleason 3 structures and 10% forming Gleason 4 structures.
4. There is no benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) seen in the samples.
5. There is no perineural invasion seen in the samples.
6. Atypia is not mentioned in the report, so the answer is "NA" (not applicable).
