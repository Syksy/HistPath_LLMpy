Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "2mm",
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary": 4,
    "secondary": 3
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": null,
  "atypia": null
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 4 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample, which is 2mm in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: An object containing the primary and secondary Gleason scores. In this case, the primary score is 4, and the secondary score is 3.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia. In this case, it's false, as the sample shows adenocarcinoma.
* `perineural_invasion`: A field indicating whether perineural invasion is present. Since it's not mentioned in the report, it's set to null.
* `atypia`: A field indicating whether atypia is present. Since it's not mentioned in the report, it's set to null.

Note that I've used null to represent missing values, as per your request.
