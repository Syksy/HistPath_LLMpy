Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "19g",
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary_pattern": 5,
    "secondary_pattern": 4
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: Since the report doesn't explicitly state the number of samples, I assume it's 1 based on the context.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions "About 19g of prostate shavings in total".
* `Gleason_score`: The report states "the highest level 5 and the second highest level 4 in the Gleason classification", so I've broken it down into primary and secondary patterns.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions a "carpet-like malignant growth", which indicates that it's not just benign hyperplasia, so this field is set to `false`.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are set to `NA` since there is no mention of them in the report.
