Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30mm",
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions three fuision biopsies, so the answer is 3.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions a total length of 30mm, so the answer is "30mm".
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions a Gleason score of 7, which is a combination of Gleason 3 and Gleason 4 patterns.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions carcinoma foci, which indicates that it's not just benign hyperplasia, so the answer is false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so the answer is false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is false.

Note that if a specific feature is not mentioned in the report, I have assumed it to be absent or unknown, and marked it as false or NA accordingly.
