Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "8mm, 7mm, 5mm",
  "Gleason_score": "3+3=6",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: 12, as there are 12 biopsies mentioned in the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: A list of sizes in millimeters, as the report mentions specific sizes for some biopsies.
* `Gleason_score`: 3+3=6, as the report mentions Gleason 3 architecture for all carcinoma findings, and the summary mentions type 3+3 adenocarcinoma.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei" (no), as the report mentions carcinoma findings in some biopsies.
* `perineural_invasion`: "ei" (no), as there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: "ei" (no), as the report explicitly states that no nuclear atypia is observed.
