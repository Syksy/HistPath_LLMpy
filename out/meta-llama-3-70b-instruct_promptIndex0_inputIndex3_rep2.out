Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "(Näytteiden määrä)": 2,
  "(Näytteiden koko)": ["60mm", "80mm"],
  "(Gleason-luokitus)": 9,
  "(Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu)": "ei",
  "(Perineuraalinen kasvu)": "NA",
  "(Atypia)": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* For question a, the answer is 2, as there are two biopsy samples taken from the patient.
* For question b, the answer is an array of two values, 60mm and 80mm, which are the lengths of the biopsy samples taken from the right and left sides, respectively.
* For question c, the answer is 9, which is the Gleason score of the biopsy sample.
* For question d, the answer is "ei" (no), as there is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia in the report.
* For questions e and f, the answers are "NA" (not available), as there is no mention of perineural growth or atypia in the report.
