Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient. In this case, it's a single sample of höyläyslastuja (TURP chips).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample, which is 4 grams in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: Since the report doesn't mention a Gleason score, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia`: The report mentions "hienoisesti prostatahyperplasiaan", which indicates benign hyperplasia of the prostate, so this field is set to true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so this field is set to false.
* `atypia`: Similarly, there is no mention of atypia in the report, so this field is set to false.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more reports!
