Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "5g",
  "Gleason_score": 8,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions that a single sample was taken from the patient, so the answer is 1.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report states that the sample weighs approximately 5g, so this is the answer.
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions that the Gleason score is 8, which is calculated based on the presence of Gleason 4 and its variants.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report explicitly mentions adenocarcinoma, which means it's not just benign hyperplasia, so the answer is false.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These values are not mentioned in the report, so I've returned NA (Not Available) for both.
