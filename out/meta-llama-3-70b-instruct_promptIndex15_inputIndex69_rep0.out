I apologize, but the provided text does not appear to be a histopathological report of a prostate biopsy. The text seems to be a poetic or literary passage, and it does not contain any information about a biopsy or prostate cancer.

If you could provide the actual histopathological report, I would be happy to help you extract the information you need.

However, I can provide a JSON response with "NA" (Not Available) for each question, indicating that the information is not available in the provided text:

```
