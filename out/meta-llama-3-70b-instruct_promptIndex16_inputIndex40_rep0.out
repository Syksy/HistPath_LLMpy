Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("14"),
  "2. Sample size": ("macrosections"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("4+3=7/7/NA"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural invasion": ("kyllä"),
  "6. Atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples is 14, as indicated by the labels A-N, with some samples having multiple parts (e.g., E-F).
2. The sample size is described as macrosections, which means they are larger sections of tissue.
3. The Gleason score is 4+3=7, with the prevailing Gleason class being 4 and some class 3.
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. Perineural invasion is abundantly observed, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
