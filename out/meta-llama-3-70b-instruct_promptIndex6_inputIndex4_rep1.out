Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions "Kaseteissa normaalin tavan mukaan otetut prostatabiopsioat", which implies that there is only one sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report states "kokonaispituus n. 150mm", which indicates the length of the sample.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of the Gleason score in the report, so I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions "hyppää esiin fokus, jossa pieniä rauhasrakenteita, missä tuma-atypiaa ja morfologinen löydös vastaisi adenokarsinoomaa", which suggests that there is a focus of atypical glands, indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia. Therefore, I've marked this field as false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `atypia`: The report mentions "tuma-atypiaa", which indicates the presence of atypia. Therefore, I've marked this field as true.
