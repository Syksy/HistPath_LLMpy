Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+4=8/4+3=7/3+4=7/NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyll채",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "kyll채"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 2, the size of the samples is not explicitly mentioned, so I answered "NA" (not available).
* For question 3, I listed all the Gleason scores mentioned in the text, separated by slashes.
* For question 4, I answered "kyll채" (yes) because the text mentions "hyperplastic changes in the epithelium", which is a characteristic of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia).
* For question 5, I answered "NA" because perineural growth is not mentioned in the text.
* For question 6, I answered "kyll채" (yes) because the text mentions "atypical glandular structure" and "carcinoma tissue", which imply the presence of atypia.
