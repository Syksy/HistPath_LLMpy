Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": "NA",
  "2. Size of samples": "19g (total), 10g (put into histology)",
  "3. Gleason score": "5+4=9",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is not explicitly mentioned, so it's marked as 'NA'.
* The size of samples is given in grams, both for the total amount and the amount put into histology.
* The Gleason score is calculated by adding the highest level (5) and the second highest level (4).
* There is no mention of BPH, perineural growth, or atypia in the given text, so they are all marked as 'NA'.
