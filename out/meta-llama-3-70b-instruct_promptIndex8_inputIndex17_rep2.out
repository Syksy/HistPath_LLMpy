Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "10mm, 7mm, 15mm, 10mm",
  "Gleason_score": "3+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "kyll채",
  "atypia": "kyll채"
}
```

Let me explain how I arrived at this structured report:

* `sample_count`: There are 4 fragments mentioned in the report, so I counted them as separate samples.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the fragments are given in millimeters, so I listed them out separately.
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions Gleason score 3 as the primary pattern and 4 as the secondary pattern, so I combined them into a single score.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since the report mentions malignant growth on the left side, I answered "ei" (no) to this question.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report mentions growth around nerves and blood vessels, which indicates perineural invasion, so I answered "kyll채" (yes).
* `atypia`: The report mentions low-grade differentiated carcinoma cells, which implies atypia, so I answered "kyll채" (yes).
