Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 12,
  "2. Size of samples": "150mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "yes",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: The Gleason score, perineural growth, and atypia detection are not mentioned in the provided text, so I've marked them as "NA" (Not Available). BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) detection is marked as "yes" since the text mentions "hyperplastisen kaltaista epiteeli√§" which suggests the presence of BPH.
