Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_size": "150mm",
  "gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of biopsy samples taken from the patient, which is 12 in this case.
* `sample_size`: The total length of the biopsy samples, which is approximately 150mm.
* `gleason_score`: Since the report does not mention a Gleason score, I have assigned a value of NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia`: The report indicates that the growth is likely benign, so I have set this field to true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I have set this field to false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I have set this field to false.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more reports!
