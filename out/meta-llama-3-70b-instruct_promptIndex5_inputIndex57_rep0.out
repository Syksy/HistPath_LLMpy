Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"location": "right base", "size": "8mm"},
    {"location": "right base", "size": "7mm"},
    {"location": "left base", "size": "5mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": 3,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_count`: The total number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 12 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: An array of objects, each describing the size of a biopsy sample. In this case, we have three samples with sizes 8mm, 7mm, and 5mm, respectively.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the carcinoma found in the biopsies, which is 3 in this case.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no carcinoma). In this case, it's false because carcinoma was found.
* `perineural_invasion`: A boolean indicating whether perineural invasion (i.e., cancer cells invading nerve fibers) was observed. In this case, it's false because there's no mention of it in the report.
* `atypia`: A boolean indicating whether atypia (i.e., abnormal cell changes) was observed. In this case, it's false because the report explicitly states that no nuclear atypia was observed.
