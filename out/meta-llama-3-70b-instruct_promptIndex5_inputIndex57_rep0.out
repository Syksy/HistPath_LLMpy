Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"location": "right base", "size": "8mm"},
    {"location": "right base", "size": "7mm"},
    {"location": "left base", "size": "5mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": 3,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: The number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 12 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: An array of objects containing the location and size of each biopsy. In this case, we have three biopsies with sizes mentioned.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the carcinoma found, which is 3 in this case.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no carcinoma). In this case, it's false because carcinoma was found.
* `perineural_invasion`: Since there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, we return NA (not available).
* `atypia`: A boolean indicating whether atypia was observed in the sample. In this case, it's false because the report explicitly states that no nuclear atypia was observed.
