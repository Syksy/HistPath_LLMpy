Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "2mm",
  "Gleason_score": 4,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 4 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample, which is 2mm in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the sample, which is 4 in this case.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia. In this case, it's false because the sample shows adenocarcinoma.
* `perineural_invasion`: Since there is no mention of perineural invasion in the original report, the value is set to NA (Not Available).
* `atypia`: Similarly, since there is no mention of atypia in the original report, the value is set to NA (Not Available).
