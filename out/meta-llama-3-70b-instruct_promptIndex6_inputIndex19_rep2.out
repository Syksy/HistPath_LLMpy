Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "12.3g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 1 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample, which is 12.3g.
* `Gleason_score`: Since the report does not mention the Gleason score, I have marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Based on the report, it seems that the sample only shows benign hyperplasia, so I have marked this as true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I have marked this as false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I have marked this as false.

Please note that if any information is missing from the report, I will mark it as NA to indicate that the value is not available.
