Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "5g",
  "Gleason_score": 8,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: Since the report mentions "a total of about 5g of prostate shavings", I assume it's a single sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions the weight of the sample as "about 5g".
* `Gleason_score`: The report states that the most representative Gleason score is 4, and the total score is 8.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor, so this field is set to `false`.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so this field is set to `false`.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so this field is set to `false`.
