Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150 mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of needle biopsies taken from the patient, which is 12 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total length of the samples, which is approximately 150 mm.
* `Gleason_score`: Since the Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Based on the report, the growth is mostly benign, so this field is set to true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so this field is set to false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia or any abnormal changes in the report, so this field is set to false.
