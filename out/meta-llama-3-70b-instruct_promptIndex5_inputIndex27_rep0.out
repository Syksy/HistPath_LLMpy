Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"location": "right base", "size": "8mm"},
    {"location": "right base", "size": "7mm"},
    {"location": "left base", "size": "5mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": {
    "right base": 3,
    "left base": 3
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_count`: The total number of biopsy samples taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: An array of objects, each describing the size or weight of a sample. In this case, we have three samples with sizes 8mm, 7mm, and 5mm, respectively.
* `Gleason_score`: An object with location-specific Gleason scores. In this case, we have Gleason scores of 3 for both the right base and left base locations.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, it's false because cancer was detected.
* `perineural_invasion`: Since there's no mention of perineural invasion in the original report, we return NA (not available).
* `atypia`: A boolean indicating whether atypia was detected. In this case, it's false because the report explicitly states that no atypia was found.
