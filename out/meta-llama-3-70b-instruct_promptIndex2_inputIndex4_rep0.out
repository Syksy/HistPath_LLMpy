Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": ("multiple"),
  "2. Näytteiden koko": ("n. 150mm"),
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": ("NA"),
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": ("NA"),
  "6. Atypia": ("kyllä")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples taken is multiple, as it is mentioned that there are several biopsy samples (e.g., "Näytteessä 1B").
2. The total length of the biopsy samples is approximately 150mm.
3. There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so the answer is NA (not available).
4. There is no evidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu) in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is NA (not available).
6. Atypia is mentioned in the report as "tuma-atypiaa", which means that atypical cells were found, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
