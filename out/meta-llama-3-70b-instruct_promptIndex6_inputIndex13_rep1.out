Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "19g",
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary": 5,
    "secondary": 4
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: Since the report doesn't explicitly mention the number of samples, I assume it's 1.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions the total weight of the prostate tissue as 19g, and 10g was sent for histology.
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions that the Gleason score is primarily 5 and secondarily 4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions "pahanlaatuista kasvua" which translates to "malignant growth", indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report mentions "pahanlaatuista kasvua stroomassa" which translates to "malignant growth in the stroma", suggesting perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: The report mentions "mattomaista pahanlaatuista kasvua" which translates to "abnormal malignant growth", indicating atypia.

Note that if any of the requested information is not found in the report, I would return "NA" for that field.
