Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 9, 
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA, 
  "Gleason_score": 3+4, 
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, 
  "perineural_invasion": NA, 
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 9 (based on the text, there are 9 samples: A-C, D-E, F-G, H-I)
* "sample_size_or_weight": NA (no information about sample size or weight is provided)
* "Gleason_score": 3+4 ( Gleason grade 3 and grade 4 differentiation are almost equal)
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false (the report mentions a large tumor, so it's not just benign hyperplasia)
* "perineural_invasion": NA (no information about perineural invasion is provided)
