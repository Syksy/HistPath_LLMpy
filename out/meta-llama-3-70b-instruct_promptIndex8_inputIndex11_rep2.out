Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 13,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "180mm",
  "Gleason_score": "3+4=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 13 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size of the sample material, which is approximately 180mm in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as 3+4=7, which means the major pattern is 3 and the minor pattern is 4, with a total score of 7.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report indicates that the sample is not only benign hyperplasia, so the value is "ei" (no).
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so the value is "ei" (no).
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the value is "ei" (no).
