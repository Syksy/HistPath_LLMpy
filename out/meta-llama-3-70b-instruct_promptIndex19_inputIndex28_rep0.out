Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "<1mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+3=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* "ei" in Finnish means "no" in English.
* "NA" means "not available" or "not mentioned" in the text.
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is "ei" (no).
* Perineural growth and atypia are not mentioned in the text, so the answers are "NA".
