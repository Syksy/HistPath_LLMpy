Here are the answers to the questions based on the provided histopathological report:

{
"(Näytteiden määrä)": 2,
"(Näytteiden koko)": ["60mm", "80mm"],
"(Gleason-luokitus)": 9,

"(Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu)": "ei",
"(Perineuraalinen kasvu)": "NA",
"(Atypia)": "NA"
}

Note: For question 2, I provided the sizes of the two samples separately, as they are different. For question 4, I answered "ei" (no) because the report mentions carcinoma, which is a malignant tumor, not a benign growth. For questions 5 and 6, I answered "NA" because the report does not mention perineural growth or atypia.
