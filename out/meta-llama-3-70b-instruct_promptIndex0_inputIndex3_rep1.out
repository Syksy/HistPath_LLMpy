  "(Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu)": "ei",
  "(Perineuraalinen kasvu)": "NA",
  "(Atypia)": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* For question a, the answer is 2, as there are two biopsy samples taken from the patient.
* For question b, the answer is an object with two properties, "oikealta" and "vasemmalta", which correspond to the lengths of the samples taken from the right and left sides, respectively.
* For question c, the answer is 9, which is the Gleason score mentioned in the report.
* For question d, the answer is "ei", as the report does not mention any benign prostatic hyperplasia.
* For questions e and f, the answers are "NA", as the report does not mention perineural growth or atypia.
