Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size": [
    {"side": "left", "size": "4mm"},
    {"side": "left", "size": "6mm"},
    {"side": "left", "size": "3mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "5mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "7mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "8mm"}
  ],
  "gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA,
  "malignancy": true,
  "margin_status": "positive"
}
```

Note: 

* `sample_count` is the total number of samples taken from the patient.
* `sample_size` is an array of objects, each containing the side (left or right) and size of the sample.
