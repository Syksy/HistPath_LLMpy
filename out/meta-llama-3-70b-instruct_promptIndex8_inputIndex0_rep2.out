Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": "1", 
  "sample_size_or_weight": "100mm", 
  "Gleason_score": "NA", 
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei", 
  "perineural_invasion": "kyllä", 
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Since the report mentions a single sample, I assumed it's 1. If it were a biopsy, I would have counted the number of biopsies.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions the sample's length as 100mm, so I used that value.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I returned NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions suspect malignancy, so I assumed it's not only benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly mentions perineural growth, so I returned "kyllä".
* `atypia`: Although the report mentions some inflammatory changes, it doesn't explicitly mention atypia, so I returned "ei".
