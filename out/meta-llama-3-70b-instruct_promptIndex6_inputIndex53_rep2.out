Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_details": [
    {
      "sample_id": 1,
      "size": "8+6mm",
      "tumor_tissue_length": "4mm",
      "gleason_score": {
        "primary_pattern": 3,
        "primary_proportion": 0.6,
        "secondary_pattern": 4,
        "secondary_proportion": 0.4
      },
      "pin_changes": true,
      "perineural_invasion": NA,
      "atypia": NA
    },
    {
      "sample_id": 2,
      "size": "10mm",
      "tumor_tissue_length": "5mm",
      "gleason_score": {
        "primary_pattern": 3,
        "primary_proportion": 0.7,
        "secondary_pattern": 4,
        "secondary_proportion": 0.3
      },
      "pin_changes": true,
      "perineural_invasion": NA,
      "atypia": NA
    },
    {
      "sample_id": 3,
      "size": "5+5mm",
      "tumor_tissue_length": NA,
      "gleason_score": NA,
      "pin_changes": false,
      "perineural_invasion": NA,
      "atypia": NA
    }
  ],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false
}
```

Note: I assumed that the absence of any mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the original report means that these features were not observed, and therefore I returned `NA` for these fields. Similarly, I assumed that the absence of any mention of tumor tissue in Sample (3) means that no tumor tissue was observed, and therefore I returned `NA` for the corresponding fields.
