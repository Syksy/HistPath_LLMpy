Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 2,
  "sample_size_or_weight": {
    "right": "60mm",
    "left": "80mm"
  },
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary": 4,
    "secondary": 5,
    "total": 9
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 2 in this case (one from the right and one from the left).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of each sample, which is 60mm for the right sample and 80mm for the left sample.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the sample, which is 9 (4+5) in this case.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia, which is false in this case since cancer is present.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are marked as NA (Not Available) since there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the original report.
