Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: 6 samples were taken from the patient, as indicated by the list of samples (1 base right, 2 center right,..., 6 apex left).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report does not provide information on the size or weight of the samples, so I returned "NA" (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is 7, which is calculated as 4+3=7, indicating poorly differentiated growth patterns.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions Gleason 5 growth patterns and poorly differentiated Gleason 4+3=7 growth, indicating that the sample is not only benign hyperplasia, so I returned `false`.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report does not mention perineural invasion, so I returned "NA" (Not Available).
* `atypia`: The report does not mention atypia, so I returned "NA" (Not Available).
