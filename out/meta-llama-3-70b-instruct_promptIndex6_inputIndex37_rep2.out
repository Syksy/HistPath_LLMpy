Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "approx. 120mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total size or weight of the biopsies, which is approximately 120mm.
* `Gleason_score`: Since the report does not mention a specific Gleason score, I have marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Although the report mentions basal cell hyperplasia, it does not explicitly state that it's only benign hyperplasia. Therefore, I have marked it as NA.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I have marked it as NA.
* `atypia`: Similarly, there is no mention of atypia in the report, so I have marked it as NA.

Please note that some fields may be marked as NA if the information is not available in the original report.
