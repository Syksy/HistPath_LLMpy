Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1, // Assuming 4g of tissue is from a single sample
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4g",
  "Gleason_score": NA, // Not mentioned in the report
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true, // The report suggests prostate hyperplasia
  "perineural_invasion": NA, // Not mentioned in the report
  "atypia": NA // Not mentioned in the report
}
```

Note that I've assumed the 4g of tissue is from a single sample, as the report doesn't explicitly state the number of samples. Also, since the report doesn't mention the Gleason score, perineural invasion, or atypia, I've marked those fields as NA (Not Available).
