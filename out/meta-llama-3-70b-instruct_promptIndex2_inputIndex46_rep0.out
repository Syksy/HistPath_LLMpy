Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("6"),
  "2. Size of the samples taken": ("NA"),
  "3. Gleason classification": ("4+4", "3+4"),
  "4. Is there benign prostatic hyperplasia?": ("ei"),
  "5. Is there perineural growth?": ("ei"),
  "6. Is there atypia?": ("ei")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The text mentions that "six macrosections and normal microscopic sections were made", so the number of samples taken is 6.
2. The text does not provide information about the size of the samples taken, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
3. The Gleason classification is mentioned as 4+4 in the apex and 3+4 in the base.
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. The text states that "there is no outgrowth from the capsule", which implies that there is no perineural growth, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
