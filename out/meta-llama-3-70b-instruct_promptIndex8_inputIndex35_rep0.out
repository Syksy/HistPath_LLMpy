Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "5g",
  "Gleason_score": "4+4=8",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: Not mentioned in the report, so NA.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Mentioned as "about 5g".
* `Gleason_score`: Mentioned as "Gleason 4 and its various variants" with a total score of 8, so represented as "4+4=8".
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since adenocarcinoma is mentioned, it's not just benign hyperplasia, so "ei" (no).
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: Not mentioned in the report, so NA.
