Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12, // assuming 12 specimens (D-G, K-P, O-Q)
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA, // not mentioned in the report
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, // tumor is present, so not only benign hyperplasia
  "perineural_invasion": false, // not mentioned in the report
  "atypia": false, // not mentioned in the report
}
```

Note that I assumed the sample count to be 12 based on the mention of specimens D-G, K-P, and O-Q. However, this might not be accurate, and the actual sample count could be different. Also, since the report does not mention the sample size or weight, I returned NA (Not Available) for that field.
