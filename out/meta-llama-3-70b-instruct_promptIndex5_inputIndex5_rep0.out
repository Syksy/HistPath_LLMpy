Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "5g",
  "Gleason_score": 8,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Since the report mentions "yhteensä noin 5g edestä prostatan höylälastuja", I assume there is only one sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The weight of the sample is approximately 5g.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is 8, which is calculated from the dominant pattern (Gleason 4) and its variants.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field is set to `false` because the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which indicates malignant growth.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field is set to `true` because the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which implies perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: This field is set to `false` because there is no mention of atypia in the report.

Note that some fields may not be applicable or may require additional information to determine their values accurately. If you have any further questions or need clarification, please let me know!
