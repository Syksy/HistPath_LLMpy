Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "(a. Näytteiden määrä)": 6,
  "(b. Näytteiden koko)": "NA",
  "(c. Gleason-luokitus)": "4+3=7",
  "(d. Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu)": "ei",
  "(e. Perineuraalinen kasvu)": "NA",
  "(f. Atypia)": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* For question b, the size of the samples is not explicitly mentioned in the report, so I answered "NA".
* For question d, since the report mentions Gleason 5 and Gleason 4+3=7, which are both malignant, I answered "ei" (no) to indicate that there is no benign hyperplasia.
* For questions e and f, there is no mention of perineural growth or atypia in the report, so I answered "NA".
