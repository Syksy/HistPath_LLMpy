Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": 4,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 4 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the samples is not mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as "NA" (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is 4, which is the most prevalent grade mentioned in the report.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, since adenocarcinoma is mentioned, the value is set to `false`.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've marked it as "NA".
* `atypia`: Similarly, there is no mention of atypia in the report, so I've marked it as "NA".

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more reports!
