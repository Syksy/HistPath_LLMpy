Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 9, // A-C, D-E, F-G, H-I
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 3+4,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: 9 samples were taken from the patient, as indicated by the different labels (A-C, D-E, F-G, H-I).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: No information is provided about the size or weight of the samples, so NA is returned.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is 3+4, indicating a dominant pattern of 3 and a secondary pattern of 4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions a "laaja kasvain" (large tumor), which suggests that the sample is not only benign hyperplasia, so this field is set to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so this field is set to false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so this field is set to false.
