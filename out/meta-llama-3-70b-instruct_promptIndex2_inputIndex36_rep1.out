Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("multiple", "D-G", "K-P", "O-Q"),
  "2. Size of the samples taken": ("NA"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("7", "3+4=7"),
  "4. Is there benign prostatic hyperplasia in the sample?": ("ei"),
  "5. Is there perineural growth in the sample?": ("ei"),
  "6. Is there atypia in the sample?": ("ei")
}
```

Note: 

* For question 1, I assumed that the multiple specimens mentioned (D-G, K-P, O-Q) correspond to multiple samples taken from the patient.
* For question 2, I couldn't find any information about the size of the samples taken, so I marked it as "NA" (not available).
* For question 3, I extracted the Gleason score from the text, which is 7, with a larger proportion having a score of 3.
* For questions 4-6, I didn't find any mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia, perineural growth, or atypia in the sample, so I marked them as "ei" (no).
