Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["8mm", "7mm", "5mm"],
  "Gleason_score": 3,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 12 according to the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the biopsies are reported as 8mm, 7mm, and 5mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as 3 for all carcinoma findings.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This is set to false because carcinoma was found in some of the biopsies.
* `perineural_invasion`: This value is set to NA (Not Available) because there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: This is set to false because the report explicitly states that no nuclear atypia was observed.
