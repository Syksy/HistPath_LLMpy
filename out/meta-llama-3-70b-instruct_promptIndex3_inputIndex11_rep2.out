Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 13,
  "2. Size of samples": "180mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 13, as mentioned in the text.
* The size of the samples is 180mm, as mentioned in the text.
* The Gleason score is 3+4=7, as the text mentions that the majority of the tumor is grade 3 and a smaller part (around 30%) is grade 4.
* BPH, perineural growth, and atypia are not mentioned in the text, so the answers are "NA" (not available).
