Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```

  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "12.3g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 1 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample, which is 12.3g.
* `Gleason_score`: Not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
