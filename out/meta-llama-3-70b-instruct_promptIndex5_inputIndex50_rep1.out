Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "num_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": [
    {"colony": 1, "score": 8, "grade3": 0, "grade4": 100},
    {"colony": 2, "score": 7, "grade3": 20, "grade4": 80},
    {"colony": 3, "score": 7, "grade3": 30, "grade4": 70}
  ],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `num_samples`: The number of biopsy specimens taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: An array of objects, each representing a colony with its corresponding Gleason score and grade proportions.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: False, since there are malignant findings in the report.
* `perineural_invasion`: Not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA.
* `atypia`: True, since atypical glandular structures were found in the report.
