Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": ("multiple"),
  "2. Näytteiden koko": ("approx. 150mm"),
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": ("NA"),
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("kyllä")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples taken is multiple, as the report mentions "Prostate biopsies" and "sample 1B" specifically.
2. The total length of the samples is approximately 150mm.
3. There is no Gleason score mentioned in the report, so the answer is NA (not available).
4. There is no evidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. The report mentions "nuclear atypia" in sample 1B, which indicates the presence of atypia, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
