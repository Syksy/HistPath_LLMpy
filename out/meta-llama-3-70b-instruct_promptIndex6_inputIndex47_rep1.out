Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"side": "left", "size": "10 mm"},
    {"side": "left", "size": "7 mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "15 mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "10 mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary_pattern": 3,
    "secondary_pattern": 4
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia_present": NA
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 4, as there are two fragments from each side of the prostate.
* The sample size or weight is reported separately for each fragment.
* The Gleason score is reported with primary and secondary patterns.
* Benign hyperplasia only is set to false, as malignant cells are present in some fragments.
* Perineural invasion is reported as true, as growth around nerves is mentioned.
* Atypia present is reported as NA, as it is not explicitly mentioned in the original report.
