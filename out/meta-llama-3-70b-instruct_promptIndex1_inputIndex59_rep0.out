I'll go through the questions one by one and provide the answers in JSON format.

**1. Näytteiden määrä:**
```
{
  "näytteiden_määrä": 3
}
```
The report mentions "Three fusion biopsies" which indicates that 3 samples were taken from the patient.

**2. Näytteiden koko:**
```
{
  "näytteiden_koko": 30,
  "määre": "mm"
}
```
The report mentions "From the total length of 30mm" which indicates that the total length of the samples is 30 millimeters.

Let me know when you're ready for me to proceed with the next questions!
