Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 13,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "about 180mm",
  "Gleason_score": "3+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 13 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the samples, which is approximately 180mm in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is a combination of two scores, 3 and 4, which indicates the aggressiveness of the cancer.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., non-cancerous growth). In this case, it's false because carcinoma was found in some of the biopsies.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are marked as NA (Not Available) because there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the original report.
