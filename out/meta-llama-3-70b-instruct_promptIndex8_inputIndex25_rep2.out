Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "2mm",
  "Gleason_score": "4+3=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: 4, because there are 4 samples mentioned in the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: "2mm", because the report mentions a 2mm area of adenocarcinoma in sample 2.
* `Gleason_score`: "4+3=7", because the report mentions that the dominant Gleason score is 4, but 3 is almost as prominent.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei", because the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: both are "NA" because there is no mention of these features in the report.
