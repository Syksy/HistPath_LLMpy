Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": "8",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "13g",
  "Gleason_score": "3+3=6",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Let me explain how I arrived at this structured report:

* `sample_count`: The text mentions "eight cassettes", which implies that there are 8 samples.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The text mentions "13g of planing chips", which gives us the weight of the sample.
* `Gleason_score`: The text explicitly states the Gleason score as "Gleason 3+3=6".
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since the text mentions "carcinoma", it implies that the sample is not just benign hyperplasia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These are not mentioned in the original text, so I returned "NA" for both.
