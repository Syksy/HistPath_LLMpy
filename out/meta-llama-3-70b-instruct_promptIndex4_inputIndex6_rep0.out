Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions multiple samples (D-G apex, basis K-P, seminaalivehikkeleit√§ O-Q), but it's not clear how many individual samples were taken. Therefore, I've assumed it's a single sample with multiple parts.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: There is no information about the size or weight of the samples, so I've returned NA.
* `Gleason_score`: The report explicitly states that the tumor is Gleason score 7.
* `benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions cancer (karsinoomaa) and Gleason score, which indicates that it's not just benign prostatic hyperplasia. Therefore, I've set this to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report does not mention perineural invasion, so I've set this to false.
* `atypia`: The report does not mention atypia, so I've set this to false.
