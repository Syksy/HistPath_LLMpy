Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: Since the report mentions multiple samples (e.g., D-G apex, basis, seminaalivehikkeleit√§), I assume there is only one patient sample, but multiple fragments or sections from that sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: There is no mention of the sample size or weight in the report, so I return NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The report explicitly states that the tumor is Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa.
* `benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions a tumor, so it's not just benign prostatic hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I return false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I return false.
