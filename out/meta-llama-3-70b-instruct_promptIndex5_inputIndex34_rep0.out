Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 1 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total length of the sample, approximately 150mm.
* `Gleason_score`: Not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: False, because the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor.
* `perineural_invasion`: Not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
* `atypia`: True, because the report mentions nuclear atypia in sample 1B.

Please note that some fields are marked as NA because they are not explicitly mentioned in the report.
