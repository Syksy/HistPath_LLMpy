Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"sample": 1, "size_or_weight": "8+6mm"},
    {"sample": 2, "size_or_weight": "10mm"},
    {"sample": 3, "size_or_weight": "5+5mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": [
    {"sample": 1, "Gleason_score": "3+4=7"},
    {"sample": 2, "Gleason_score": "3+4=7"},
    {"sample": 3, "Gleason_score": NA}
  ],
  "benign_hyperplasia": "kyll채",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "kyll채"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 3, as there are three samples mentioned in the report.
* The sample size or weight is reported for each sample separately.
* The Gleason score is reported for each sample separately, except for sample 3 where no tumor tissue was found.
* Benign hyperplasia is reported as "kyll채" (yes) since PIN changes were observed in samples 1 and 2.
* Perineural invasion is reported as "ei" (no) since it was not mentioned in the report.
* Atypia is reported as "kyll채" (yes) since PIN changes were observed in samples 1 and 2.
