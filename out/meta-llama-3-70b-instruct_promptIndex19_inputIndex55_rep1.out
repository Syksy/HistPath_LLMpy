Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 4,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+3=7/7/NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 2, the size of the samples is not mentioned, so I answered "NA" (not available).
* For question 3, the Gleason score is reported as grade 4 being the most prevalent, and grade 3 being almost as large a percentage, so I answered "4+3=7/7/NA".
* For question 4, there is no mention of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the text, so I answered "ei" (no).
* For questions 5 and 6, there is no mention of perineural growth or atypia in the text, so I answered "NA" (not available).
