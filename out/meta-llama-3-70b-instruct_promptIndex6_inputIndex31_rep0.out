Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions "Six formalin-fixed preparations", so the answer is 6.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: There is no information about the size or weight of the samples, so the answer is NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The report states that the majority of growth is seen in Gleason class 3 (about 60%), and the rest in class 4, resulting in a total score of 3+4=7.
* `benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only`: The report does not suggest that the sample only shows benign prostatic hyperplasia, as it mentions Gleason scores and other features. Therefore, the answer is false.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly states that there is no perineural invasion, so the answer is false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is false.
