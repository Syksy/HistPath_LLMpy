Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "8mm and 5mm",
  "Gleason_score": "4+4 (apex) and 3+4 (base)",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 6, as mentioned in the report.
* The sample size or weight is reported as 8mm and 5mm, which are the sizes of the foci of the malignant samples.
* The Gleason score is reported separately for the apex and base, as it varies between these two locations.
* Benign hyperplasia only is set to false, as adenocarcinoma is found in the samples.
* Perineural invasion and atypia are marked as NA, as there is no mention of these features in the report.
