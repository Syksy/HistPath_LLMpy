Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "8mm and 5mm",
  "Gleason_score": "4+4 and 3+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 6, because six macrosections were made from the prostatectomy resect.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "8mm and 5mm", because the sizes of the foci of the malignant samples are approximately 8mm and 5mm.
* "Gleason_score": "4+4 and 3+4", because the Gleason score is 4+4 in the apex and 3+4 in the base.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because adenocarcinoma is found in the samples, indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion" and "atypia": NA, because there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the original report.
