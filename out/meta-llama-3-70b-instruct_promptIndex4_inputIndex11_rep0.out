Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 13,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "180mm",
  "Gleason_score": "3+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of biopsy samples taken from the patient, which is 13 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the biopsy material, which is approximately 180mm in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the tumor, which is 3+4 in this case, indicating that the majority of the tumor is grade 3 and a smaller portion is grade 4 (approximately 30%).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, it's false because cancer was detected in five of the biopsy samples.
* `perineural_invasion`: Since there is no mention of perineural invasion in the original report, the value is set to NA (not available).
* `atypia`: Similarly, since there is no mention of atypia in the original report, the value is set to NA (not available).
