Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "19g (10g sent for histology)",
  "3. Gleason score": "5+4=sum",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyll√§",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is assumed to be 1 since the text only mentions "Prostatalastuja" (prostate sample) in singular form.
* The size of the samples is given as 19g, with 10g sent for histology.
* The Gleason score is reported as having mostly grade 5 and secondly grade 4, but the exact score is not explicitly stated.
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) can be detected in the samples taken, as the text mentions "fibromuskulaaria stroomaa" which is a characteristic of BPH.
* There is no mention of perineural growth or atypia in the text, so the answers are "ei" (no).
