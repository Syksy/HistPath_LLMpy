Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "12",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "8mm, 7mm, 5mm",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "3+3=6",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "ei",
  "6. Atypia": "ei"
}
```

Let me explain each answer:

1. The patient has 12 biopsies taken.
2. The sizes of the biopsies are 8mm, 7mm, and 5mm.
3. The Gleason score is 3+3=6, which means the major pattern is 3 and the minor pattern is also 3, summing up to 6.
4. There is no evidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the biopsies.
5. There is no evidence of perineural invasion in the biopsies.
6. There is no evidence of atypia in the biopsies.
