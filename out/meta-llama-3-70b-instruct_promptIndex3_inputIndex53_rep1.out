Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 3,
  "2. Size of samples": ["8+6mm", "10mm", "5+5mm"],
  "3. Gleason score": ["3+4=7", "3+4=7", "NA"],
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "yes"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 2, I provided a list of sizes for each sample.
* For question 3, I provided a list of Gleason scores for each sample, where 'NA' indicates that no Gleason score was mentioned for that sample.
* For questions 4 and 5, I answered 'NA' because there is no mention of BPH or perineural growth in the text.
* For question 6, I answered 'yes' because PIN changes were mentioned in the text, which can be considered as atypia.
