Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1, // Assuming 4g of tissue is one sample
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: Since the report mentions 4g of tissue, I assume it's one sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions 4g of tissue, so I use that as the sample size/weight.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I return NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions "hienoisesti prostatahyperplasiaan", which suggests that the sample shows benign hyperplasia, so I return true.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: There is no mention of these features in the report, so I return NA for both.
