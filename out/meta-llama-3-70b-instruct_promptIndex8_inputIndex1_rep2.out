Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": "3+4=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: 6, as there are 6 formalin-fixed preparations mentioned in the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, as there is no mention of the size or weight of the samples in the report.
* `Gleason_score`: "3+4=7", as the report mentions a Gleason score of 3 (60%) and 4, which sums up to 7.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei", as the report mentions independent growth of glands, indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: "ei", as the report explicitly states that there is no perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: NA, as there is no mention of atypia in the report.
