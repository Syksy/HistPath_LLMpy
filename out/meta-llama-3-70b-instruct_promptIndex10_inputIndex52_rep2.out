Note: 

* The number of samples is 9, as there are 2 macrosections per base (D-E, F-G) and 2 samples from seminal vesicles (H-I), in addition to the apex samples (A-C).
* The size of the samples is not specified in the report, so the answer is NA.
* The Gleason score is 3-4, as the report states that the prevailing Gleason grade 3 and grade 4 differentiation is almost equal.
* There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or atypia in the report, so the answers are "ei" and NA, respectively.
* There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is NA.
