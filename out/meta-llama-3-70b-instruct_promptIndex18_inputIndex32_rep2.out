Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 3,
  "2. Size of samples": "90mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. Can BPH be detected": "kyllä",
  "5. Can perineural growth be detected": "ei",
  "6. Can atypia be detected": "ei"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 3, the Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
* For question 4, the text mentions "hyperplasia" which is a characteristic of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia), so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
* For question 5, there is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is "ei" (no).
* For question 6, the text explicitly states "no atypia", so the answer is "ei" (no).
