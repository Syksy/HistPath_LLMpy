Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "120mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: 6, as mentioned in the report ("6 representative prostate biopsies")
* `sample_size_or_weight`: "120mm", as mentioned in the report ("approx. 120mm in total")
* `Gleason_score`: NA, as no Gleason score is mentioned in the report
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: false, as the report mentions "Suspicio finding on biopsies" which suggests that there may be something more than just benign hyperplasia
* `perineural_invasion`: NA, as there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report
* `atypia`: false, as there is no mention of atypia in the report
