Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "100mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia_present": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: Not mentioned in the report, so NA.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions a total length of 100mm, so this value is used.
* `Gleason_score`: Not mentioned in the report, so NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions suspicious malignancy, so this is set to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly mentions perineural growth, so this is set to true.
* `atypia_present`: The report does not mention atypia, and only mentions moderate inflammatory changes, so this is set to false.
