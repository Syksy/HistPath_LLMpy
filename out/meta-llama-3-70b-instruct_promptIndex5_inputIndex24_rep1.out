Based on the provided free-text histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 8,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 8 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Since the report doesn't mention the size or weight of the samples, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The report doesn't mention the Gleason score, so I've marked it as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia`: The report states that the finding is benign, indicating that the patient has benign prostatic hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report doesn't mention perineural invasion, so I've marked it as false.
* `atypia`: The report doesn't mention atypia, so I've marked it as false.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more reports!
