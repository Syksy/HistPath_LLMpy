Based on the provided free-text histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 8,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 8 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Since the report doesn't mention the size or weight of the samples, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I've marked it as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report states that the finding is benign, indicating that there is only benign hyperplasia and no malignancy.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've marked it as false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I've marked it as false.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more reports!
