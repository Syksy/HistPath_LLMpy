Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size": "90mm",
  "gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 3 in this case.
* `sample_size`: The total length of the samples, which is 90mm.
* `gleason_score`: Since the Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, it is marked as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia`: The report suggests that the sample contains glandular structures that may indicate hyperplasia, so this field is marked as true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so this field is marked as false.
* `atypia`: The report explicitly states that no atypia or findings suggestive of malignancy were found, so this field is marked as false.
