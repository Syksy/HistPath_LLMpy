Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "n. 120mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "yes",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: The Gleason score, perineural growth, and atypia information are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so I've marked them as "NA" (Not Available).
