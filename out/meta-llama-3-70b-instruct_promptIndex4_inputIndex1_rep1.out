Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: 6, as there are six formalin-fixed samples mentioned in the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, as there is no information about the size or weight of the samples in the report.
* `Gleason_score`: 7, which is calculated as 3+4 based on the report.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: false, as the report mentions Gleason score and perineural invasion, indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: false, as the report explicitly states that there is no perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: NA, as there is no mention of atypia in the report.
