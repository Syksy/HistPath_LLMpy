Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "150mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "yes"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is assumed to be 1 since only one sample (1B) is mentioned in the text.
* The size of the samples is given as 150mm.
* The Gleason score, BPH detection, and perineural growth detection cannot be determined from the provided text, so they are marked as 'NA' (not available).
* Atypia detection is marked as 'yes' since the text mentions "tuma-atypiaa" which means nuclear atypia in Finnish.
