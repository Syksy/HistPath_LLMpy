Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 8,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyllä",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions that the samples have been started in eight blocks, so the number of samples is 8.
2. The size of the samples is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
3. The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
4. Although the text does not explicitly mention BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia), the finding is described as benign, which suggests that BPH might be present, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. The text does not mention atypia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
