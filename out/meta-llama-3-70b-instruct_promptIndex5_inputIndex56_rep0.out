Based on the provided free-text histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_size": "150 mm",
  "gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of needle biopsies taken from the patient, which is 12 in this case.
* `sample_size`: The total length of the samples, which is approximately 150 mm.
* `gleason_score`: Since the Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, I've assigned it a value of NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia`: This field indicates whether the report suggests benign growth, which is true in this case.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've assigned it a value of false.
* `atypia`: Similarly, there is no mention of atypia in the report, so I've assigned it a value of false.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more reports!
