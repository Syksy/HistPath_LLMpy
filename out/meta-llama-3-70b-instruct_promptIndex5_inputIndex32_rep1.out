Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "90mm",
  "gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 3 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total length of the samples, which is 90mm.
* `gleason_score`: Not applicable (NA) since there is no mention of Gleason score in the report.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: True, since the report mentions hyperplasia and no findings suggestive of malignancy.
* `perineural_invasion`: False, since there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: False, since the report explicitly states that no atypia was found.
