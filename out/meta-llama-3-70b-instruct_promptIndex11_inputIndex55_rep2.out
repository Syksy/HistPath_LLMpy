Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "Näytteiden määrä": 4,
  "Näytteiden koko": "2mm",
  "Gleason-luokitus": "4+3",
  "Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "Atypia": "NA"
}
```

Let me explain how I arrived at these answers:

1. Näytteiden määrä: The text mentions "Samples 1-4", which implies that there are 4 samples.
2. Näytteiden koko: The text mentions "an approximately 2mm area of adenocarcinoma", which suggests that the sample size is approximately 2mm.
3. Gleason-luokitus: The text mentions "The most prevalent Gleason in the finding is grade 4, although grade 3 is almost as large a %", which implies that the Gleason score is 4+3.
4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu: The text does not mention anything about benign prostatic hyperplasia, and the diagnosis is adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor. Therefore, the answer is "ei".
5. Perineuraalinen kasvu: There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is "NA".
6. Atypia: There is no mention of atypia in the text, so the answer is "NA".
