Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 4,
  "2. Size of samples": "2mm (only for sample 2)",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+3=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The size of the samples is only mentioned for sample 2, so I couldn't provide a general size for all samples.
* There is no mention of BPH, perineural growth, or atypia in the given text, so I marked them as 'NA' (not available).
