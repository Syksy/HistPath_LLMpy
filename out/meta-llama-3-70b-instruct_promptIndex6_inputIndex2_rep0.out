Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "90mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* "sample_count": 3, because the report mentions "3 prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita" (3 prostate needle biopsies).
* "sample_size_or_weight": "90mm", because the report mentions "Näytteiden yhteispituus 90mm" (total length of the samples is 90mm).
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention the Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": true, because the report suggests that the changes seen may be due to hyperplasia, and there is no mention of malignant findings.
* "perineural_invasion": false, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": false, because the report explicitly states "ei atypiaa" (no atypia).
