I'm happy to help! However, I notice that the provided text is an error message from a SQL query, not a histopathology report. It seems that there is a syntax error in the SQL query, and the error message is indicating that the specified column names (sample_count, sample_amount, gleason_grade, patient_bph, sample_perineural_invasion, sample_atypia) are not found in the MAIN_TABLE.

Since there is no actual histopathology report provided, I cannot extract the requested information. If you could provide the actual report, I'd be happy to assist you in extracting the required information.

Please provide the histopathology report, and I'll do my best to extract the information and provide it in JSON format.
