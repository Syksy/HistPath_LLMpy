Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "num_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["5mm", "10mm", null, null, null, null],
  "Gleason_score": [8, 7, 7, null, null, null],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": null,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `num_samples`: The number of biopsy samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: An array of sample sizes or weights, where available. In this case, only samples 1 and 2 have reported sizes (5mm and 10mm, respectively).
* `Gleason_score`: An array of Gleason scores, where available. In this case, samples 1, 2, and 3 have reported Gleason scores (8, 7, and 7, respectively).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, the value is `false` because cancer is present in some samples.
* `perineural_invasion`: A boolean indicating whether perineural invasion is present. In this case, the value is `null` because it is not mentioned in the report.
* `atypia`: A boolean indicating whether atypia is present. In this case, the value is `true` because atypia is mentioned in sample 1.
