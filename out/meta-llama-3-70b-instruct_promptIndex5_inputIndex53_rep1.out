Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "samples": 3,
  "sample_details": [
    {
      "sample_id": 1,
      "size": "8+6mm",
      "tumor_size": "4mm",
      "gleason_score": 7,
      "gleason_pattern": {
        "3": 0.6,
        "4": 0.4
      },
      "perineural_invasion": null,
      "atypia": true
    },
    {
      "sample_id": 2,
      "size": "10mm",
      "tumor_size": "5mm",
      "gleason_score": 7,
      "gleason_pattern": {
        "3": 0.7,
        "4": 0.3
      },
      "perineural_invasion": null,
      "atypia": true
    },
    {
      "sample_id": 3,
      "size": "5+5mm",
      "tumor_size": NA,
      "gleason_score": NA,
      "gleason_pattern": NA,
      "perineural_invasion": NA,
      "atypia": NA
    }
  ],
  "benign_hyperplasia": true,
  "perineural_invasion": null,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Note: 

* `NA` is used to indicate that the value is not available or not applicable.
* `gleason_pattern` is an object with keys representing the Gleason patterns and values representing the proportions.
* `benign_hyperplasia` is set to `true` since the report mentions "no unusual prostate tissue" in Sample (3), indicating benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion` is set to `null` since it is not mentioned in the report.
* `atypia` is set to `true` since the report mentions "PIN changes" in Samples (1) and (2).
