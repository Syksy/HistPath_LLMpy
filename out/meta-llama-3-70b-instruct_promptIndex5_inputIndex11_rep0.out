Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 13,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "180mm",
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary": 3,
    "secondary": 4,
    "percentage_secondary": 30
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Let me explain how I arrived at this structured report:

* `sample_count`: The number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 13 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the biopsy material, which is approximately 180mm in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is a grading system used to evaluate the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. In this case, the primary grade is 3 and the secondary grade is 4, with the secondary grade making up about 30% of the tumor.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, since cancer was detected in five biopsies, the value is `false`.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields were not mentioned in the original report, so I returned `NA` (Not Available) for both.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to clarify anything!
