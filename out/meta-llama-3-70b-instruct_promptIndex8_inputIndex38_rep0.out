Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": "6",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30g",
  "Gleason_score": "NA",
  "benign_hyperplasia": "kyllä",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient is 6, as mentioned in the report ("six blocks").
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total weight of the samples is 30g, as mentioned in the report.
* `Gleason_score`: Since there is no mention of Gleason score in the report, the value is set to "NA".
* `benign_hyperplasia`: The report suggests that the finding is suitable for suspected benign hyperplasia, so the value is set to "kyllä" (yes).
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so the value is set to "ei" (no).
* `atypia`: The report explicitly states that no atypia is visible, so the value is set to "ei" (no).
