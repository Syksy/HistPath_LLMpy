Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "Biopsia",
  "number_of_samples": 13,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "180mm",
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary_pattern": 3,
    "secondary_pattern": 4,
    "percentage_of_secondary_pattern": 30
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": null,
  "atypia": null
}
```

Note: Since the report does not explicitly mention benign hyperplasia only, perineural invasion, or atypia, I have set these fields to `false` or `null` accordingly.
