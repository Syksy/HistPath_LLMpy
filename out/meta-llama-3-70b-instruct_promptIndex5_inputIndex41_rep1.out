Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "Biopsia",
  "number_of_samples": 13,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "180mm",
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary": 3,
    "secondary": 4,
    "percentage_of_secondary": 30
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": null,
  "atypia": null
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_type`: The type of sample, which in this case is a biopsy.
* `number_of_samples`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 13.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample material, which is approximately 180mm.
* `Gleason_score`: An object containing the Gleason score information. The primary score is 3, the secondary score is 4, and the percentage of the secondary score is 30%.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (false in this case, since carcinoma was found).
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are null since there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the original report.
