Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 3,
  "2. Size of samples": "4g",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "yes",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 3, as the text mentions that the planing chips were launched into three tissue cassettes.
* The size of the samples is 4g, as mentioned in the text.
* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as "NA".
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) detection is marked as "yes" because the text mentions "subtly prostatic hyperplasia".
* Perineural growth and atypia detection are marked as "NA" because they are not mentioned in the text.
