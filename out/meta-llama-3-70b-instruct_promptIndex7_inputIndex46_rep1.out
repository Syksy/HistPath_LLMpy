Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "8mm and 5mm",
  "Gleason_score": "4+4 and 3+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "NA",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

* "sample_size_or_weight": "8mm and 5mm", because the report mentions the sizes of the foci of the malignant samples.

* "benign_hyperplasia_only": "NA", because the report does not mention anything about benign hyperplasia only.
* "perineural_invasion": "NA", because the report does not mention anything about perineural invasion.
