Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 14,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+3",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "yes",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples is 14, as there are 4 samples labeled A-D, 2 samples labeled E-F, 7 samples labeled G-N, and 1 sample labeled N-O.
2. The size of the samples is not specified in the text, so the answer is "NA".
3. The Gleason score is 4+3, as the dominant Gleason class is 4, and there is also some Gleason class 3 present.
4. There is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) in the text, so the answer is "NA".
5. Perineural growth is detected, as the text mentions "Perineuraalista invaasiota havaitaan runsaasti" which translates to "Perineural invasion is abundant".
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so the answer is "NA".
