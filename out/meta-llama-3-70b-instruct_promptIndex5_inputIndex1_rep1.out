Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Since the original text does not mention the size or weight of the samples, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is 7, which is calculated as 3+4 based on the text.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia. In this case, it's set to false because the sample also shows malignant growth.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field indicates whether perineural invasion is present in the sample. According to the text, there is no perineural invasion, so it's set to false.
* `atypia`: This field indicates whether atypia is present in the sample. There is no mention of atypia in the original text, so it's set to false.
