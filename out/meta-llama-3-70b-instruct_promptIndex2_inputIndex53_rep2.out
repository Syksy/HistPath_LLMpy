Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("3"),
  "2. Size of samples": ("8+6mm, 10mm, 5+5mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("7 (3+4)"),
  "4. Presence of high-grade PIN": ("kyllä"),
  "5. Presence of perineural invasion": ("NA"),
  "6. Presence of atypia": ("kyllä")
}
```

Note: 

* For question 4, I assumed that "PIN changes" refer to high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), which is a precursor lesion to prostate cancer.
* For question 5, I answered "NA" because there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* For question 6, I answered "kyllä" because PIN changes are a type of atypia.
