Based on the provided text, I will extract the relevant information and convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the result:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

The reason for all values being NA (Not Available) is that the provided text does not contain any information related to the specific questions asked. The text appears to be a summary of a patient's medical history and treatment plan, but it does not include any histopathological information.
