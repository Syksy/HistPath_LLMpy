Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("6"),
  "2. Size of the samples": ("about 30g, of which about 20g were started in six blocks"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("NA"),
  "4. Benign hyperplasia found": ("kyll√§"),
  "5. Perineural growth found": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia found": ("ei")
}
```

Note: The Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so I answered "NA" (not available). Similarly, perineural growth is not mentioned, so I answered "ei" (no).
