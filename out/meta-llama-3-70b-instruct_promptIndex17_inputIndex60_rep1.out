I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text "Beep boop? Boop biip. Blarp!" does not appear to be a legitimate medical note written by a pathologist in Finnish. It seems to be a nonsensical sequence of words.

As a result, I'm unable to extract any meaningful information from the text. Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

{
"1. How many samples have been taken?": "NA",
"2. What is the size of the samples taken?": "NA",
"3. What is the Gleason score of the samples?": "NA",
"4. Can BPH be detected in the samples taken?": "NA",
"5. Can perineural growth be detected in the samples taken?": "NA",
"6. Can atypia be detected in the samples taken?": "NA"
}

If you could provide a legitimate medical note in Finnish, I'd be happy to assist you in extracting the necessary information.
