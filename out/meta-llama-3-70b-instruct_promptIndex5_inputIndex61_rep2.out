Based on the provided text, I will attempt to extract the relevant information and convert it into a structured format in JSON.

Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

The reason for all values being `NA` is that the provided text does not contain any relevant information related to the questions asked. The text appears to be a nonsensical sequence of words and numbers, without any mention of biopsy samples, prostate tissue, or any other relevant medical terms.

If you could provide a real histopathological report, I would be happy to help you extract the relevant information and convert it into a structured format in JSON.
