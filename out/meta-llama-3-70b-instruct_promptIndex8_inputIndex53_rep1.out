Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"sample": 1, "size_or_weight": "8+6mm"},
    {"sample": 2, "size_or_weight": "10mm"},
    {"sample": 3, "size_or_weight": "5+5mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": [
    {"sample": 1, "Gleason_score": "3+4=7"},
    {"sample": 2, "Gleason_score": "3+4=7"},
    {"sample": 3, "Gleason_score": NA}
  ],
  "benign_hyperplasia": "kyll채",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "kyll채"
}
```

Note: 

* `number_of_samples` is 3, as there are three samples mentioned in the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight` is an array of objects, each containing the sample number and its corresponding size or weight.
* `Gleason_score` is an array of objects, each containing the sample number and its corresponding Gleason score. For sample 3, the Gleason score is NA, as it is not mentioned in the report.
* `benign_hyperplasia` is "kyll채", as PIN changes are mentioned in the report, which are a type of benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion` is "ei", as there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia` is "kyll채", as PIN changes are mentioned in the report, which are a type of atypia.
