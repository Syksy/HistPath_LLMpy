Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4+6+3 mm (left), 5+7+8 mm (right)",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 6, because there are 6 samples mentioned in the report (4+6+3 on the left and 5+7+8 on the right).
* "sample_size_or_weight": The sizes of the samples are provided, but it's a bit unclear due to the mistake in indexing. I've kept the original values, but it's possible that the sizes should be swapped between left and right.
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the Gleason score is not mentioned in the report.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions malignant growth and positive margins, indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* "atypia": NA, because there is no mention of atypia in the report.
