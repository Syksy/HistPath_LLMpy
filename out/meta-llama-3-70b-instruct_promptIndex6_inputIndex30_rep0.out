Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "100mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia_present": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: Since the report doesn't explicitly mention the number of samples, I assume it's 1 based on the context.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions the total length of the sample as 100mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The report doesn't provide a Gleason score, so I return NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions suspicious malignant growth, so this field is set to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly states perineural growth, which is suspicious for malignancy, so this field is set to true.
* `atypia_present`: The report doesn't mention atypia or any changes deviating from normal tissue, so this field is set to false.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
