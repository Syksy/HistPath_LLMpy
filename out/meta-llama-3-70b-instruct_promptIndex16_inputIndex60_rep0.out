I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text "Beep boop? Boop biip. Blarp!" does not contain any relevant information about the histopathological sample. It appears to be a nonsensical sequence of words.

As a result, I cannot provide answers to the questions based on this text. If you could provide a real histopathological report, I would be happy to assist you in extracting the relevant information.

Here is an example of how I would respond in JSON format if I had a real report to work with:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "NA",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "NA",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "NA"
}
```

Please provide a real report, and I'll do my best to extract the relevant information for you!
