Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": "NA",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "kyllä"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: Since the report mentions "total length approx. 150mm" and "In sample 1B", I assume there is only one sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions "total length approx. 150mm", so I use this value.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I return "NA".
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions "adenocarcinoma", which is a malignant tumor, so I return "ei".
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I return "ei".
* `atypia`: The report mentions "nuclear atypia", so I return "kyllä".
