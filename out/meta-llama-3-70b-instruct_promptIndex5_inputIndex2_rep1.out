Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size": "90mm",
  "gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 3 in this case.
* `sample_size`: The total length of the samples, which is 90mm.
* `gleason_score`: Since the Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, it is marked as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia`: This field is set to true because the report mentions "hyperplasiaan" (hyperplasia) and "stroomaa" (stroma), which suggests benign hyperplastic changes.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field is set to false because there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: This field is set to false because the report explicitly states "ei atypiaa" (no atypia).
