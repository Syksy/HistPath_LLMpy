Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_type": "höyläyslastu",
  "number_of_samples": 8,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "13g",
  "Gleason_score": "3+3=6",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_type`: The type of sample, which in this case is a höyläyslastu (TURP specimen).
* `number_of_samples`: The number of samples taken, which is 8 (kasetilla).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample, which is 13g.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the sample, which is 3+3=6.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (false in this case, since carcinoma was detected).
* `perineural_invasion`: A boolean indicating whether perineural invasion was detected (false in this case, since it was not mentioned).
* `atypia`: A boolean indicating whether atypia was detected (false in this case, since it was not mentioned).

Note that since the report did not mention perineural invasion or atypia, I defaulted those fields to false. If the report had mentioned them, I would have set the corresponding fields to true.
