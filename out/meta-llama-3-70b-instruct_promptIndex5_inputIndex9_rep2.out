Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_type": "höyläyslastu",
  "number_of_samples": 8,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "13g",
  "Gleason_score": "3+3=6",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": null,
  "atypia": null
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_type`: The type of sample, which in this case is a höyläyslastu (TURP specimen).
* `number_of_samples`: The number of samples taken, which is 8 (kasetilla).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample, which is 13g.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the tumor, which is 3+3=6.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (false in this case, since carcinoma was detected).
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are null because there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the report.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more reports!
