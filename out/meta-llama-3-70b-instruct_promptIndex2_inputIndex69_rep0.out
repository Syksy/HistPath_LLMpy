I apologize, but the text you provided does not seem to be a histopathological report, but rather a poetic passage. It does not contain any information about a patient's biopsy samples or their characteristics.

If you could provide the actual histopathological report, I would be happy to help you extract the information you need.

However, since you asked, I'll provide a JSON response with "NA" (Not Available) for each question, indicating that the information is not available in the provided text.
