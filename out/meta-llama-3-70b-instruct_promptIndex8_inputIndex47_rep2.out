Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "10 mm, 7 mm, 15 mm, 10 mm",
  "Gleason_score": "3+4=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "kyll채",
  "atypia": "kyll채"
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: There are 4 samples (2 from the left side and 2 from the right side).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the samples are given in millimeters.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as 3+4=7, indicating a major type 3 and minor type 4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report indicates that there are malignant cells present, so this is set to "ei" (no).
* `perineural_invasion`: The report mentions growth around nerves, so this is set to "kyll채" (yes).
* `atypia`: The report mentions low-differentiated carcinoma cells, which implies atypia, so this is set to "kyll채" (yes).
