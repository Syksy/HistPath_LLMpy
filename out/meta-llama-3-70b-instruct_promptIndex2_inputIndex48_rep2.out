Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("6"),
  "2. Sample size": ("4+6+3 mm", "5+7+8 mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("NA"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("NA"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("NA"),
  "6. Atypia": ("NA")
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 6 (3 from the left and 3 from the right).
* The sample sizes are 4+6+3 mm from the left and 5+7+8 mm from the right.
* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as "NA" (not available).
* There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia, perineural growth, or atypia in the report, so they are all marked as "NA".
