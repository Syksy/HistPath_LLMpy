Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 9, 
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA, 
  "Gleason_score": 3+4, 
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, 
  "perineural_invasion": NA, 
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: 9 samples were taken from the patient (A-C, D-E, F-G, H-I).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: No information is provided about the size or weight of the samples, so NA is returned.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is 3+4, indicating that the tumor has both grade 3 and grade 4 differentiation.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions a large tumor, so this field is set to false, indicating that the sample is not only benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so NA is returned.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so NA is returned.
