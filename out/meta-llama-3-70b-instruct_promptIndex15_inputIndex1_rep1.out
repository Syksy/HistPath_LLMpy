Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "(6)",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "(NA)",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "(3+4=7)",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "(ei)",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "(ei)",
  "6. Atypia": "(ei)"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has 6 samples (A-F).
2. The size of the samples is not specified in the report.
3. The Gleason score is 3+4=7, which means the majority (around 60%) of the tumor is grade 3 and the rest is grade 4.
4. There is no benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) mentioned in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. The report explicitly states that there is no perineural invasion, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
