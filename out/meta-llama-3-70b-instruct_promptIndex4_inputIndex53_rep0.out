Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"sample": 1, "size": "8+6mm"},
    {"sample": 2, "size": "10mm"},
    {"sample": 3, "size": "5+5mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": [
    {"sample": 1, "score": 7, "pattern_3": 60, "pattern_4": 40},
    {"sample": 2, "score": 7, "pattern_3": 70, "pattern_4": 30}
  ],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia_present": true
}
```

Note: 

* `number_of_samples` is the total number of samples taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight` is an array of objects, each containing the sample number and its corresponding size or weight.
* `Gleason_score` is an array of objects, each containing the sample number, Gleason score, and proportions of patterns 3 and 4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only` is a boolean indicating whether the sample shows only benign hyperplasia (false in this case).
* `perineural_invasion` is marked as NA (Not Available) since it is not mentioned in the original report.
* `atypia_present` is a boolean indicating whether atypia is present in the sample (true in this case, since PIN changes are mentioned).
