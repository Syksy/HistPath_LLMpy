Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_type": "Biopsianäytteet",
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "Gleason_pattern": "4+3",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_type`: The type of sample, which is "Biopsianäytteet" (biopsy samples) in this case.
* `number_of_samples`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the samples, which is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (not available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score, which is 7 in this case.
* `Gleason_pattern`: The Gleason pattern, which is 4+3 in this case.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample shows only benign hyperplasia, which is false in this case since Gleason 5 and 4+3 growth patterns are observed.
* `perineural_invasion`: A boolean indicating whether perineural invasion is observed, which is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA.
* `atypia`: A boolean indicating whether atypia is observed, which is false in this case since it's not mentioned in the report.
