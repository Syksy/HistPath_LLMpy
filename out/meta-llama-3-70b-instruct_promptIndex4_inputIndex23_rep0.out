Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"sample": 1, "size": "8+6mm"},
    {"sample": 2, "size": "10mm"},
    {"sample": 3, "size": "5+5mm"}
  ],
  "gleason_score": [
    {"sample": 1, "score": 7, "pattern3": 60, "pattern4": 40},
    {"sample": 2, "score": 7, "pattern3": 70, "pattern4": 30},
    {"sample": 3, "score": NA}
  ],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: An array of objects, each containing the sample number and its corresponding size or weight.
* `gleason_score`: An array of objects, each containing the sample number, Gleason score, and the percentage of pattern 3 and pattern 4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (false in this case).
* `perineural_invasion`: A boolean indicating whether perineural invasion is present (false in this case).
* `atypia`: A boolean indicating whether atypia is present (true in this case, as PIN-muutoksia is mentioned in the report).

Note that I've used `NA` to indicate that the Gleason score is not applicable for sample 3, as it does not contain any cancerous tissue.
