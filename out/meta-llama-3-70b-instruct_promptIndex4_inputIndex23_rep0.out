Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"sample": 1, "size": "8+6mm"},
    {"sample": 2, "size": "10mm"},
    {"sample": 3, "size": "5+5mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": [
    {"sample": 1, "score": 7, "pattern_3": 60, "pattern_4": 40},
    {"sample": 2, "score": 7, "pattern_3": 70, "pattern_4": 30},
    {"sample": 3, "score": NA}
  ],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia_present": true
}
```

Note: 

* `NA` stands for Not Available or Not Applicable.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only` is set to `false` because the report mentions adenocarcinoma.
* `perineural_invasion` is set to `false` because it is not mentioned in the report.
* `atypia_present` is set to `true` because PIN-muutoksia (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) are mentioned in the report.
