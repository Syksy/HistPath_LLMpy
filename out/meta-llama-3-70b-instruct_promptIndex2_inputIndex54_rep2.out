Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "(8)",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "(NA)",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "(NA)",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "(kyllä)",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "(ei)",
  "6. Atypia": "(ei)"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has 8 samples (blocks) taken.
2. The size of the samples is not specified in the report, so it's marked as "NA" (not available).
3. There is no Gleason score mentioned in the report, so it's marked as "NA".
4. The report states that the finding is benign, which implies that there is no malignant growth, so it's marked as "kyllä" (yes) for benign growth.
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so it's marked as "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so it's marked as "ei" (no).
