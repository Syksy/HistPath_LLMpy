Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["10mm", "8mm", "14mm", "14mm"],
  "Gleason_score": "3+4=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* `number_of_samples` is 4, as there are 4 samples mentioned in the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight` is an array of values, as each sample has a different size.
* `Gleason_score` is reported as "3+4=7", which corresponds to the Gleason score mentioned in the report.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only` is "ei" (no), as adenocarcinoma is seen in one of the samples.
* `perineural_invasion` is "ei" (no), as it is explicitly stated that perineural invasion is not seen in the samples.
* `atypia` is reported as "NA", as there is no mention of atypia in the report.
