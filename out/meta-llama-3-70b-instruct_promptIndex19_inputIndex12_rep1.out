Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 12,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyllä",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text states that 12 kudosblokkia (tissue blocks) were taken, so the answer is 12.
2. The size of the samples is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
3. The Gleason score is mentioned as 7, with the majority (around 60%) being grade 3, so the answer is 3+4=7.
4. The text mentions "rauhasrakennetta" which translates to "glandular structure", which is a characteristic of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia), so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
6. The text does not mention atypia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
