Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "100mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Since the report doesn't explicitly mention the number of samples, I assume it's a single sample. If there's any ambiguity, please clarify.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions the total length of the sample as 100mm.
* `Gleason_score`: Since the report doesn't mention the Gleason score, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions "suspekti maligni" which suggests that the sample is not only benign hyperplasia, so I've marked it as false.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly mentions "perineuraalia kasvua", which indicates perineural invasion, so I've marked it as true.
* `atypia`: The report doesn't mention atypia, but it does mention "kohtalaisesti tulehdusmuutoksia" which could be related to inflammation rather than atypia. To be cautious, I've marked it as false. If you'd like to interpret it differently, please let me know.
