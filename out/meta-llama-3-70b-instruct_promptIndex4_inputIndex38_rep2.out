Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "20g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient is 6, as mentioned in the phrase "started in six blocks".
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the samples is approximately 20g, as mentioned in the phrase "about 20g were started in six blocks".
* `Gleason_score`: Since there is no mention of Gleason score in the report, it is marked as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions that the finding is suitable for suspected benign hyperplasia, so this field is set to true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so this field is set to false.
* `atypia`: The report explicitly states that no atypia is visible, so this field is set to false.
