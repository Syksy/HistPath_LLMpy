I apologize, but the provided text does not appear to be a medical note written by a pathologist in Finnish. The text seems to be a poem or a piece of creative writing.

As a result, I am unable to extract the requested information from the text. The answers to the questions would be:

{
"1. Number of samples": NA,
"2. Size of samples": NA,
"3. Gleason score": NA,
"4. BPH detection": NA,
"5. Perineural growth detection": NA,
"6. Atypia detection": NA
}

If you could provide a actual medical note in Finnish, I would be happy to assist you in extracting the requested information.
