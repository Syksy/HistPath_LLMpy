Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "5g",
  "Gleason_score": 8,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": null,
  "atypia": null
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: The text mentions "a total of about 5g of prostate shavings", implying a single sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The weight of the sample is approximately 5g.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is mentioned as 8, with the most representative being Gleason 4 and its variants.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The text explicitly mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor, so this field is set to false.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These features are not mentioned in the original text, so they are set to null (NA).
