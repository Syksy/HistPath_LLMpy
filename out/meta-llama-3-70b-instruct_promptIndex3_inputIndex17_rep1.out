Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 4,
  "2. Size of samples": ["10mm", "7mm", "15mm", "10mm"],
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "yes",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 4, as there are two fragments from the left side and two from the right side.
* The sizes of the samples are listed as an array.
* The Gleason score is reported as 3+4, which means the primary pattern is 3 and the secondary pattern is 4.
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) and atypia are not mentioned in the text, so the answers are 'NA' (Not Available).
* Perineural growth is mentioned in the text, so the answer is 'yes'.
