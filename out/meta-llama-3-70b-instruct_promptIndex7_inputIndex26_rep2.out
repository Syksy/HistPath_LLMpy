Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 12, because the report mentions 12 needle biopsies.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm", because the report mentions a total length of 150mm for the samples.
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention a Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": true, because the report concludes that the growth is benign and similar to hyperplastic epithelium.
* "perineural_invasion" and "atypia": NA, because the report does not mention these specific features.
