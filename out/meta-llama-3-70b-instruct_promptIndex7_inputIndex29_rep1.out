Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30mm",
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples" is 3, as there are three fuusiobiopsiaa (fusion biopsies) mentioned in the report.
* "sample_size_or_weight" is "30mm", which is the total length of the samples.
* "Gleason_score" is 7, which is the overall Gleason score mentioned in the report.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only" is false, as the report mentions carcinoma foci and Gleason scores, indicating malignant growth.
* "perineural_invasion" and "atypia" are both NA, as there is no mention of these features in the report.
