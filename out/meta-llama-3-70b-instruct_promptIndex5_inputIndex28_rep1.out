Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": "4+3=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the samples is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as "NA" (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as 4+3=7, with a small area (<1mm) showing Gleason 5 pattern.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since the report mentions Gleason scores, it's clear that the sample is not just benign hyperplasia, so this field is set to `false`.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so it's marked as "NA".
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so it's marked as "NA".
