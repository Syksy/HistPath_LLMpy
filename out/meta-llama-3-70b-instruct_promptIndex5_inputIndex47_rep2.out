Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size": [
    {"side": "left", "size": "10 mm"},
    {"side": "left", "size": "7 mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "15 mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "10 mm"}
  ],
  "gleason_score": {
    "primary": 3,
    "secondary": 4
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 4 in this case.
* `sample_size`: An array of objects, each describing the size of a sample from either the left or right side of the prostate.
* `gleason_score`: An object with two properties, `primary` and `secondary`, which represent the primary and secondary Gleason scores, respectively.
* `benign_hyperplasia`: Since the report does not mention benign hyperplasia, the value is set to NA (not available).
* `perineural_invasion`: This field is set to `true` because the report mentions growth around nerves.
* `atypia`: Since the report does not mention atypia, the value is set to NA (not available).
