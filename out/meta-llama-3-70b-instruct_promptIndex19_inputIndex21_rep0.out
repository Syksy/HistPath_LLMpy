Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 3,
  "2. Size of samples": "4g",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyllä",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions that the samples were divided into three tissue cassettes, so the number of samples is 3.
2. The size of the samples is 4 grams, as mentioned in the text.
3. There is no mention of the Gleason score in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
4. The text mentions "hienoisesti prostatahyperplasiaan", which suggests that BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) can be detected in the samples, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
