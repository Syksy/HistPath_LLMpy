Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 4,
  "2. Size of samples": "10mm, 7mm, 15mm, 10mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7/7",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "yes",
  "6. Atypia detection": "kyll√§"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. Four samples have been taken, two from the left side and two from the right side.
2. The sizes of the samples are 10mm, 7mm, 15mm, and 10mm.
3. The Gleason score is 3+4=7, with pattern 3 being the primary pattern and pattern 4 being the secondary pattern.
4. There is no mention of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the text, so it's unlikely to be detected.
5. Perineural growth is mentioned in the text, so it can be detected.
6. Atypia is implied by the presence of "matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa" (low-grade differentiated carcinoma cells), so it can be detected.
