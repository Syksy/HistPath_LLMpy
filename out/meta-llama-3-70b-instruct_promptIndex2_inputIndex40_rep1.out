Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("14"),
  "2. Size of samples": ("macrosections"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("4+3=7"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural invasion": ("kyllä"),
  "6. Atypia": ("NA")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples is 14, as indicated by the labels A-N.
2. The size of the samples is described as macrosections, which means they are larger sections of tissue.
3. The Gleason score is reported as having a prevailing class of 4 and some class 3, so the sum would be 4+3=7.
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. Perineural invasion is explicitly mentioned in the report as being abundantly observed, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "NA" (not applicable).
