Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("14"),
  "2. Size of the samples": ("macrosections"),
  "3. Gleason classification": ("4+3=7"),
  "4. Is there benign prostatic hyperplasia in the sample?": ("ei"),
  "5. Is there perineural invasion in the sample?": ("kyllä"),
  "6. Is there atypia in the sample?": ("NA")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples taken is 14, as indicated by the labels A-N.
2. The size of the samples is described as macrosections, which means they are larger sections of tissue.
3. The Gleason classification is 4+3=7, indicating that the prevailing Gleason class is 4, with some class 3.
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia in the sample, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. Perineural invasion is abundantly observed, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the sample, so the answer is "NA" (not applicable).
