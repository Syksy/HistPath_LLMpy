Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 6, because the report mentions "Six formalin-fixed preparations".
* "sample_size_or_weight": NA, because the report does not provide information about the size or weight of the samples.
* "Gleason_score": 7, because the report states that the majority of growth is seen in Gleason class 3 (about 60%), and the rest in class 4, so 3+4=7.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions glandular fusion and Gleason scores, indicating malignant growth.
* "perineural_invasion": false, because the report explicitly states that there is no perineural invasion.
* "atypia": NA, because the report does not provide information about atypia.
