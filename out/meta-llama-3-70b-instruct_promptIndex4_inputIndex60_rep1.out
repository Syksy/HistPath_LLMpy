I'm happy to help!

After analyzing the provided text, I must conclude that it doesn't contain any relevant information for a histopathological report. The text appears to be a collection of nonsensical words and sounds.

Therefore, I will return a JSON-formatted response with NA (Not Available) values for each of the requested fields:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia_present": NA
}
```

If you could provide a real histopathological report, I'd be happy to assist you in converting it into a structured format!
