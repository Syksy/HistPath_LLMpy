Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of biopsy specimens": ("6"),
  "2. Size of biopsy specimens": ("NA"),
  "3. Gleason classification": ("4+4=8", "4+3=7", "3+4=7"),
  "4. Presence of benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("kyll채"),
  "5. Presence of perineural growth": ("NA"),
  "6. Presence of atypia": ("kyll채")
}
```

Note: 

* For question 2, the size of the biopsy specimens is not mentioned in the report, so I answered "NA" (not available).
* For question 3, there are multiple Gleason classifications mentioned in the report, so I listed all of them.
* For question 4, the report mentions "hyperplastic changes in the epithelium" which suggests the presence of benign prostatic hyperplasia, so I answered "kyll채" (yes).
* For question 5, there is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so I answered "NA" (not available).
* For question 6, the report mentions "atypical glandular structure" which suggests the presence of atypia, so I answered "kyll채" (yes).
