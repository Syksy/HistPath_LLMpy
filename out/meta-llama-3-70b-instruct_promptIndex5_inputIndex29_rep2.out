Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size": "30mm",
  "gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of biopsy samples taken from the patient, which is 3 in this case.
* `sample_size`: The total length of the biopsy samples, which is 30mm.
* `gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the cancerous tissue, which is 7 (3+4).
* `benign_hyperplasia`: This field indicates whether the sample shows only benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, it's false, as cancerous tissue is present.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field indicates whether perineural invasion (i.e., cancerous growth around nerves) is present. In this case, it's false, as there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: This field indicates whether atypia (i.e., abnormal cell changes) is present. In this case, it's false, as there is no mention of atypia in the report.

Note that some fields may have a value of `NA` if the information is not available in the report.
