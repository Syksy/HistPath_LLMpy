Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 2,
  "sample_size_or_weight": {
    "right": "60mm",
    "left": "80mm"
  },
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary": 4,
    "secondary": 5,
    "total": 9
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 2 in this case (one from the right and one from the left).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of each sample, which is reported in millimeters (mm) for both the right and left samples.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported with primary, secondary, and total scores. In this case, the primary score is 4, the secondary score is 5, and the total score is 9 (4+5).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample shows only benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, the answer is false, as a carcinoma is found in sample B.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field indicates whether perineural invasion (i.e., cancer cells invading the nerves) is present. Since this information is not mentioned in the original report, the value is reported as NA (not available).
* `atypia`: This field indicates whether atypia (i.e., abnormal changes in the tissue) is present. In this case, the answer is false, as no significant inflammation or atypia is mentioned in the original report.
