Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 2,
  "sample_size_or_weight": {
    "right": "60mm",
    "left": "80mm"
  },
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary": 4,
    "secondary": 5,
    "total": 9
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is assumed to be 2, as there are two separate measurements mentioned for the right and left sides.
* The sample size or weight is reported separately for the right and left sides.
* The Gleason score is broken down into primary, secondary, and total scores.
* Benign hyperplasia only is set to false, as a carcinoma is found in one of the samples.
* Perineural invasion is marked as NA, as it is not mentioned in the original report.
