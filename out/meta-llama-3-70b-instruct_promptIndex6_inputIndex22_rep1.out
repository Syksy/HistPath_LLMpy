Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 9, // A-C, D-E, F-G, H-I
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA", // Not mentioned in the report
  "Gleason_score": 3+4, // Dominant Gleason score 3 and score 4 equally frequent
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, // Not mentioned as benign hyperplasia only
  "perineural_invasion": false, // Not mentioned
  "atypia": false // Not mentioned
}
```

Note: The number of samples is inferred from the description of the samples taken from the prostate (Apex näytteisiin A-C, kaksi makroleikettä kohti basista D-E, F-G basis ja H-I kaksi näytettä seminaalivehikkeleistä). The sample size or weight is not mentioned in the report, so it is marked as "NA". The Gleason score is reported as 3+4, indicating that the dominant Gleason score is 3 and score 4 is equally frequent. The report does not mention benign hyperplasia only, perineural invasion, or atypia.
