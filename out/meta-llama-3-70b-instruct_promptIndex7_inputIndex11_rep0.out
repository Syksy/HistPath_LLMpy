Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 13,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "180mm",
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary_pattern": 3,
    "secondary_pattern": 4,
    "percentage_of_secondary_pattern": 30
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Note: I've assumed that the Gleason score is reported as a range (3 and 4) rather than a single value, so I've broken it down into primary and secondary patterns with a percentage of the secondary pattern. If this is not the case, please let me know and I'll adjust accordingly.
