Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 3,
  "2. Size of samples": ["8+6mm", "10mm", "5+5mm"],
  "3. Gleason score": ["3+4=7", "3+4=7", "NA"],
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "yes",
  "6. Atypia detection": "kyllä"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. Three samples have been taken, labeled as Näyte (1), Näyte (2), and Näyte (3).
2. The sizes of the samples are 8+6mm, 10mm, and 5+5mm, respectively.
3. The Gleason scores are 3+4=7 for samples 1 and 2, and NA (not applicable) for sample 3, which does not show any cancerous tissue.
4. BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not detected in any of the samples (ei).
5. Perineural growth is detected in samples 1 and 2 (yes).
