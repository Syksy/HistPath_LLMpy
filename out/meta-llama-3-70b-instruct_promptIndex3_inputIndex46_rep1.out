Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "8mm and 5mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+4=8 and 3+4=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 6, as mentioned in the text ("six macrosections").
* The size of the samples is given as 8mm and 5mm, which are the sizes of the foci of the malignant samples.
* The Gleason score is given as 4+4=8 for the apex and 3+4=7 for the base.
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia), perineural growth, and atypia are not mentioned in the text, so the answers are "NA" (Not Available).
