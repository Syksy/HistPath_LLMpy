Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "no",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions "Kuusi formaliinifiksoitua preparaattia", which means "Six formalin-fixed preparations", so there are 6 samples.
2. The size of the samples is not mentioned in the text, so it's NA (Not Available).
3. The Gleason score is mentioned as 3+4=7, which means the major component is 3 and the minor component is 4, with a total score of 7.
4. There is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) in the text, so it's "ei" (no).
5. The text explicitly states "eik√§ vesikkeli- tai perineuraali-invaasiota", which means "no vesicular or perineural invasion", so perineural growth is not detected.
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so it's NA (Not Available).
