Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": ("12"),
  "2. Näytteiden koko": ("NA"),
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": ("3+4=7"),
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": ("NA"),
  "6. Atypia": ("NA")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has 12 tissue blocks taken.
2. The size of the tissue blocks is not specified in the report, so I marked it as "NA" (not available).
3. The Gleason score is 7, with a major component of 3 (60% of the tumor) and a minor component of 4.
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or any other type of benign growth, so I marked it as "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural invasion, so I marked it as "NA" (not available).
6. There is no mention of atypia, so I marked it as "NA" (not available).
