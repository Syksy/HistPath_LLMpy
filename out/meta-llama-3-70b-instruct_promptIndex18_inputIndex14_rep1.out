Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 4,
  "2. Size of samples": ["10mm", "8mm", "14mm", "14mm"],
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7/90%/10%",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Note: 

* "ei" means "no" in Finnish.
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not explicitly mentioned in the text, but based on the context, it seems that the samples 2 and 3 represent healthy prostate tissue, which might imply that BPH is not detected.
* Atypia is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is "ei" (no).
