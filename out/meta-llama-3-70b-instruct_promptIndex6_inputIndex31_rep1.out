Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions "Six formalin-fixed preparations", so the answer is 6.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: There is no information about the size or weight of the samples, so the answer is NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions "Gleason class 3 (about 60%), the rest in class 4, so 3+4=7", so the answer is 7.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions "independent growth as glands" and "Gleason class 3" and "Gleason class 4", which indicates that the sample is not only benign hyperplasia, so the answer is false.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly states "no perineural invasion", so the answer is false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is false.
