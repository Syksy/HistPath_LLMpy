Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 13,
  "2. Size of samples": "180mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The Gleason score is calculated based on the text, which mentions "a larger proportion of the separate gland-forming class than class 3 and a smaller proportion of 4". This is interpreted as a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
* BPH, perineural growth, and atypia are not mentioned in the text, so the answers are marked as "NA" (not available).
