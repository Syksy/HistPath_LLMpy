I apologize, but the provided text does not appear to be a histopathological report. It seems to be a passage from a physics textbook, discussing the concept of work and kinetic energy.

As a result, I cannot extract the requested information from the text. Instead, I will return a JSON object with NA values for each of the requested fields:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": "NA",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": "NA",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "NA",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

If you could provide an actual histopathological report, I would be happy to assist you in extracting the relevant information and converting it into a structured format.
