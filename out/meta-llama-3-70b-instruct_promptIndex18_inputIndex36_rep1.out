Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": "NA",
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7/7/NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 1, the number of samples is not explicitly mentioned, so I answered "NA" (Not Available).
* For question 2, the size of samples is not mentioned, so I answered "NA".
* For question 3, the Gleason score is mentioned as 7, with a larger proportion having a score of 3, so I answered "3+4=7/7/NA".
* For questions 4, 5, and 6, BPH, perineural growth, and atypia are not mentioned in the text, so I answered "ei" (no).
