Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "30g",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "yes",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "no"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The text mentions that the samples were divided into six blocks, so there are 6 samples.
2. The total weight of the samples is 30g, and 20g of it was used for the analysis.
3. There is no mention of the Gleason score in the text, so it's marked as "NA" (not available).
4. The text mentions "hyv√§nlaatuiseen hyperplasiaan", which translates to "benign hyperplasia", which is another term for BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia). So, BPH can be detected in the samples.
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so it's marked as "NA" (not available).
6. The text explicitly states that there is no atypia, so the answer is "no".
