Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 4,
  "2. Size of samples": "2mm (only for sample 2)",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+3=7/NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 2, the size is only mentioned for sample 2, so I couldn't provide a general size for all samples.
* For question 3, the Gleason score is reported as a combination of major (4) and minor (3) components, with a sum of 7. However, the exact percentage of each component is not provided, so I couldn't fill in the percentage fields.
* For question 4, BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not mentioned in the text, so I assumed it's not detected.
* For questions 5 and 6, perineural growth and atypia are not mentioned in the text, so I marked them as NA (Not Available).
