Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": "3+4=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: 12, as there are 12 tissue blocks obtained from the shavings.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, as no specific size or weight is mentioned in the report.
* `Gleason_score`: "3+4=7", as the Gleason sum is 7, with a larger portion being class 3 (about 60% of the tumor).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei", as carcinoma is seen in a small part of the chips, indicating that it's not only benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: NA, as there is no mention of these features in the report.
