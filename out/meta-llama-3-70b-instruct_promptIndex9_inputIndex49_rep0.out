Here are the answers to the questions based on the provided histopathological report:

{
"(Näytteiden määrä)": "NA",
"(Näytteiden koko)": 12.3,
"(Gleason-luokitus)": "NA",
"(Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu)": "kyllä",
"(Perineuraalinen kasvu)": "ei",
"(Atypia)": "ei"
}

Note: 

* For question 1, the report does not mention the number of samples taken, so the answer is "NA".
* For question 2, the report mentions the total weight of the samples as 12.3g, but it does not specify the size of individual samples. However, I assumed that the question is asking for the total weight of the samples, so I provided the answer as 12.3.
* For question 3, the report does not mention the Gleason score, so the answer is "NA".
* For question 4, the report mentions "stromal hyperplasia" which can be interpreted as a benign proliferation of stromal cells, so the answer is "kyllä".
* For question 5, the report does not mention perineural growth, so the answer is "ei".
* For question 6, the report does not mention atypia, so the answer is "ei".
