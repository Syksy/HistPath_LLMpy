Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30mm",
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 3 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total length of the biopsies, which is 30mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the carcinoma, which is 7.
* `benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the biopsy shows only benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Since the report mentions carcinoma, this field is set to `false`.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field indicates whether perineural invasion is present in the biopsy. Since the report does not mention it, this field is set to `NA`.
* `atypia`: This field indicates whether atypia is present in the biopsy. Since the report does not mention it, this field is set to `NA`.
