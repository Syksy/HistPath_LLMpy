Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("6"),
  "2. Size of the samples taken": ("NA"),
  "3. Gleason classification": ("4+4", "3+4"),
  "4. Is there benign prostatic hyperplasia?": ("ei"),
  "5. Is there perineural growth?": ("ei"),
  "6. Is there atypia?": ("NA")
}
```

Note: 

* For question 2, the size of the samples taken is not specified, so I answered "NA".
* For question 3, there are two different Gleason classifications mentioned in the text (4+4 and 3+4), so I listed both.
* For question 4, there is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia, so I answered "ei" (no).
* For question 5, there is no mention of perineural growth, so I answered "ei" (no).
* For question 6, there is no mention of atypia, so I answered "NA".
