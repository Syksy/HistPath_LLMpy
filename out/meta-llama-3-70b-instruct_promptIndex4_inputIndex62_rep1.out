I'll do my best to extract the relevant information from the given text and provide a structured response in JSON format.

Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

The reason for all the `NA` values is that the provided text does not contain any relevant information about the histopathological sample. The text appears to be a test sentence with no actual data. If you provide a real histopathological report, I'll be happy to help you extract the relevant information!
