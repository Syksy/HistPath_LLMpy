Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("6"),
  "2. Sample size": ("NA"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("4+3=7"),
  "4. Well-differentiated growth": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has 6 biopsy samples (1 base right, 2 center right, 3 apex right, 4 base left, 5 center left, 6 apex left).
2. The size of the samples is not specified, so the answer is NA (not available).
3. The Gleason score is 4+3=7, which indicates poorly differentiated growth.
4. There is no well-differentiated growth observed in the samples, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
