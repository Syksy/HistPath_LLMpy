Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "19g",
  "Gleason_score": "5, 4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Since the report doesn't explicitly mention the number of samples, I assumed it's 1, as it's a single prostate tissue sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions the weight of the sample as 19g.
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions that the Gleason score is mostly composed of grade 5 and secondarily grade 4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since the report mentions "pahanlaatuista kasvua" (malignant growth), it's clear that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report mentions "pahanlaatuista kasvua stroomassa" (malignant growth in the stroma), which suggests perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I assumed it's false.
