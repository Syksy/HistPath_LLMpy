Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "19g",
  "Gleason_score": "5, 4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "false",
  "perineural_invasion": "true",
  "atypia": "true"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient. In this case, it's 1, as there is no indication of multiple samples.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample, which is 19g in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the sample, which is a combination of scores 5 and 4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia. In this case, it's false, as the sample shows malignant growth.
* `perineural_invasion`: A boolean indicating whether perineural invasion is present in the sample. In this case, it's true, as the sample shows "pahanlaatuista kasvua stroomassa" (malignant growth in the stroma).
* `atypia`: A boolean indicating whether atypia is present in the sample. In this case, it's true, as the sample shows "mattomaista pahanlaatuista kasvua" (malignant growth with atypical features).
