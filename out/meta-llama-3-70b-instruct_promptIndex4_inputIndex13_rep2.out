Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "19g",
  "Gleason_score": "5, 4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient. In this case, it's not explicitly stated, but based on the context, I assume it's 1.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample(s). In this case, it's approximately 19g.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the sample. In this case, it's a combination of scores 5 and 4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, it's false because the report mentions "pahanlaatuista kasvua" (malignant growth).
* `perineural_invasion`: Whether perineural invasion (i.e., cancer cells surrounding nerves) is present in the sample. In this case, it's true because the report mentions "pahanlaatuista kasvua stroomassa" (malignant growth in the stroma).
* `atypia`: Whether atypia (i.e., abnormal cell changes) is present in the sample. In this case, it's false because there's no mention of atypia in the report.
