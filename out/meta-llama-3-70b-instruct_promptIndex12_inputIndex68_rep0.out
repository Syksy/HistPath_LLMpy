I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text does not appear to be a histopathology report, but rather a physics text discussing the concept of work and kinetic energy. As a result, I will not be able to extract the requested information.

Here is the response in JSON format:

```
{
  "Näytteiden määrä": "NA",
  "Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "NA",
  "Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "Atypia": "NA"
}
```

If you could provide an actual histopathology report, I would be happy to assist you in extracting the requested information.
