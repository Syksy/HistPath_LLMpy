Based on the provided medical note, I'll extract the relevant information and provide the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": "NA",
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "9/NA/NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The text does not mention the number of samples taken, so I've marked it as "NA" (Not Available).
2. There is no information about the size of the samples, so I've marked it as "NA".
3. The Gleason score is mentioned as "yhdeks√§n", which translates to "nine" in English. However, the format requested is "major+minor=sum/sum/NA", but since only the total score is provided, I've filled in the available information and marked the rest as "NA".
4. There is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) in the text, so I've marked it as "NA".
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so I've marked it as "NA".
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so I've marked it as "NA".
