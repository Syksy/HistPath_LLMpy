Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": ("8"),
  "2. Näytteiden koko": ("13g"),
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": ("3+3=6"),
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu": ("kyllä"),
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": ("NA"),
  "6. Atypia": ("NA")
}
```

Note: 

* Question 1: The number of samples is 8, as indicated by "eight cassettes".
* Question 2: The total weight of the samples is 13g.
* Question 3: The Gleason score is 3+3=6.
* Question 4: Since carcinoma was found histologically, it can be inferred that there is malignant growth, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
* Questions 5 and 6: There is no information about perineural growth or atypia in the given text, so the answers are "NA" (not available).
