Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "120mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the samples, which is approximately 120mm in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: Since the Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, the value is set to NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions basaalisoluhyperplasiaa (basal cell hyperplasia), which is a benign condition, but it also mentions a suspicious finding, so the value is set to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so the value is set to NA.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the value is set to NA.
