Here are the answers in JSON format:

  "3. What is the Gleason score of the samples?": "8, 7, 7",

  "5. Can perineural growth be detected in the samples taken?": "NA",
  "6. Can atypia be detected in the samples taken?": "kyll√§"
}
```

Note: 

* In question 2, the sizes mentioned are 5mm and 10mm, but it's not clear if these are the sizes of all samples or just some of them.
* In question 4 and 5, the text does not mention BPH or perineural growth, so the answer is NA (not available).
* In question 6, the text mentions "huonosti erilaistunutta atyyppista rauhasrakennetta" which translates to "poorly differentiated atypical glandular structure", so atypia can be detected in the samples taken.
