It seems like the provided text is not a histopathological report, but rather a medical report from an emergency department. It does not contain any information about tissue samples, Gleason score, or other histopathological features.

Therefore, I will return a JSON-formatted response with NA values for all questions, as the information is not available in the provided text:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": "NA",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": "NA",
  "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia": "NA",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Please provide a histopathological report, and I'll be happy to help you extract the relevant information.
