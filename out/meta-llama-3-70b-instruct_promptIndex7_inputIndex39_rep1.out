Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 8,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "13g",
  "Gleason_score": "3+3=6",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples" is 8, as there are eight cassettes mentioned in the report.
* "sample_size_or_weight" is "13g", which is the total weight of the planing chips.
* "Gleason_score" is "3+3=6", which is the Gleason score mentioned in the report.
* The other fields ("benign_hyperplasia_only", "perineural_invasion", and "atypia") are marked as NA (Not Available) since there is no information about them in the report.
