Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 8,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "13g",
  "Gleason_score": "3+3=6",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 8, because the report mentions "eight cassettes".
* "sample_size_or_weight": "13g", because the report mentions "13g of planing chips".
* "Gleason_score": "3+3=6", because the report explicitly mentions the Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only", "perineural_invasion", and "atypia" are all NA, because the report does not mention anything about these specific features.
