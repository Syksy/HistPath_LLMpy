Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of biopsy samples taken from the patient, which is 12 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total length of the biopsy samples, which is approximately 150mm.
* `Gleason_score`: Since the report does not mention a Gleason score, I have marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia`: The report indicates that the growth is likely benign, so this field is set to true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so this field is set to false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so this field is set to false.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more reports!
