Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "5mm, 10mm, NA",
  "Gleason_score": "8, 7, 7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "kyllä"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of each biopsy, which is 5mm for the first biopsy, 10mm for the second, and NA for the rest since the sizes are not specified.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason scores for each biopsy, which are 8, 7, and 7 respectively.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Whether the biopsies show only benign hyperplasia, which is "ei" (no) in this case since adenocarcinoma is present.
* `perineural_invasion`: Whether perineural invasion is present, which is NA since it's not mentioned in the report.
* `atypia`: Whether atypia is present, which is "kyllä" (yes) since atypical glandular structures are mentioned in the report.
