Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": ["8 (4+4)", "7 (4+3)", "7 (3+4)"],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": "kyll√§"
}
```

Note: Since there are multiple Gleason scores mentioned in the report, I have represented them as an array of values. If you would like to represent them differently, please let me know!
