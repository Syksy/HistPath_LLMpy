Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "100mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient. In this case, it's not mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample(s). In this case, it's mentioned as 100mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no malignancy). In this case, since the report mentions "suspekti maligni" (suspected malignancy), I've set this field to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field indicates whether perineural invasion (i.e., cancer cells invading nerve fibers) is present. In this case, the report explicitly mentions "havaitaan perineuraalia kasvua" (perineural growth is observed), so I've set this field to true.
* `atypia`: This field indicates whether atypical changes (i.e., changes that don't fit normal tissue architecture) are present. In this case, the report doesn't mention atypia explicitly, but it does mention "kohtalaisesti tulehdusmuutoksia" (moderate inflammatory changes), which might be related to atypia. However, to be conservative, I've set this field to false.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to clarify any of these fields!
