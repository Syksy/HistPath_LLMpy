Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("multiple", "D-G, K-P, O-Q"),
  "2. Size of the samples taken": ("not specified", "NA"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("7", "3+4=7", "7"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("no", "ei", "NA"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("no", "ei", "NA"),
  "6. Atypia": ("no", "ei", "NA")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has multiple samples taken, specifically from the apex (D-G), base (K-P), and seminal vesicles (O-Q).
2. The size of the samples taken is not specified in the report.
3. The Gleason score is 7, with a major component of 3 and a minor component of 4, making it a Gleason 3+4=7 carcinoma.
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the report, so it is assumed to be absent.
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so it is assumed to be absent.
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so it is assumed to be absent.
