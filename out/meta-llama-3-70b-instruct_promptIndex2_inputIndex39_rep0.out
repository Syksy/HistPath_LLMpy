Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": ("8"),
  "2. Näytteiden koko": ("13g"),
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": ("3+3=6"),
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu": ("kyllä"),
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": ("NA"),
  "6. Atypia": ("NA")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples taken is 8, as indicated by the phrase "eight cassettes".
2. The total weight of the samples is 13g, as stated in the report.
3. The Gleason score is 3+3=6, which indicates a moderate-grade cancer.
4. Since carcinoma was found histologically, it can be inferred that there is malignant growth, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
