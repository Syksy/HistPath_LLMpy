Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_biopsies": 13,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "180mm",
  "Gleason_score": "3+4=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_biopsies`: 13 biopsies were taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sample size is approximately 180mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is 3+4=7, indicating a larger proportion of class 3 and a smaller proportion of class 4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The answer is "ei" (no) because carcinoma was found in some of the biopsies.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report does not mention perineural invasion, so the answer is "NA".
* `atypia`: The report does not mention atypia, so the answer is "NA".
