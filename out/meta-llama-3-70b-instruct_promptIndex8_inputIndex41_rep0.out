Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_biopsies": 13,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "180mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_biopsies`: 13 biopsies were taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sample size is approximately 180mm, but it's not clear if this refers to the total length of all biopsies or a single biopsy.
* `Gleason_score`: No Gleason score is mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since carcinoma was found in five biopsies, it's clear that not all samples showed only benign hyperplasia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: There is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the report, so both are marked as NA.
