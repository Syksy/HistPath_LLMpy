Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "approx. 120mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples" is 6, as stated in the report.
* "sample_size_or_weight" is approximately 120mm, as stated in the report.
* "Gleason_score" is NA, as it is not mentioned in the report.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only" is NA, as the report mentions basal cell hyperplasia, but it's not clear if it's the only finding.
* "perineural_invasion" is NA, as it is not mentioned in the report.
* "atypia" is NA, as it is not mentioned in the report.

Note that I've used NA to indicate missing or uncertain values, rather than 0 or no, as per your instructions.
