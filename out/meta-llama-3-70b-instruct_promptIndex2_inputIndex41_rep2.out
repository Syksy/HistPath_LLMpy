Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "13",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "about 180mm",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "3+4=7",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has 13 biopsies.
2. The total material is about 180mm.
3. The Gleason score is 3+4=7, which means the major pattern is 3 and the minor pattern is 4, with a total score of 7.
4. There is no benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) mentioned in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
