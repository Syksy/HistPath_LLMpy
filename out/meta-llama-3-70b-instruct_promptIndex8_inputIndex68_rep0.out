I apologize, but the provided text does not appear to be a histopathological report. It seems to be a passage from a physics textbook, discussing the concept of work and kinetic energy.

As a result, I cannot extract the requested information from the text. Instead, I will return a JSON object with all values set to "NA", indicating that the information is not available.

Here is the JSON response:

```
{
  "sample_count": "NA",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": "NA",
  "benign_hyperplasia": "NA",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Please provide a valid histopathological report, and I will be happy to assist you in extracting the requested information.
