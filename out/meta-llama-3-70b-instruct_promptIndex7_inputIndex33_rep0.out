Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 2,
  "sample_size_or_weight": {"right": "60mm", "left": "80mm"},
  "Gleason_score": 9,
  "Gleason_breakdown": {"primary": 4, "secondary": 5},
  "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is assumed to be 2, as there are two separate measurements for the right and left sides.
* The sample size or weight is reported separately for the right and left sides.
* The Gleason score is reported as a total score of 9, with a breakdown of primary and secondary scores.
* Benign prostatic hyperplasia only is set to false, as carcinoma is found in one of the samples.
* Perineural invasion is marked as NA, as there is no mention of it in the report.
* Atypia is set to false, as there is no mention of any atypical changes in the report.
