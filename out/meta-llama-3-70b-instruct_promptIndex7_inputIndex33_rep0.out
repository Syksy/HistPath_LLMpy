Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 2,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "60mm (right), 80mm (left)",
  "Gleason_score": 9,
  "Gleason_breakdown": "4+5",
  "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Note: I assumed that the "change in question" refers to the carcinoma, and since it's not explicitly stated to be atypical, I set `atypia` to `false`. If you think this interpretation is incorrect, please let me know.
