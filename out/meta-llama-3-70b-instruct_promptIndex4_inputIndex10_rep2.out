Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 14, // A-D, E-F, G-N, N-O
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 4,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Note: The sample count is estimated based on the description of the samples (A-D, E-F, G-N, N-O), but the exact size or weight of the samples is not provided. Similarly, there is no mention of atypia in the original report, so it is marked as NA.
