Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "19g",
  "Gleason_score": "5+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 1, because the report mentions "prostate shavings" in plural form, but it's likely that it's a single sample.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "19g", because the report mentions the total weight of the shavings.
* "Gleason_score": "5+4", because the report mentions the highest level 5 and the second highest level 4 in the Gleason classification.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions a "carpet-like malignant growth" which indicates cancer.
* "perineural_invasion" and "atypia": NA, because the report does not mention anything about perineural invasion or atypia.
