Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": "NA",
  "2. Size of samples": "about 5g",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+4=8",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 1, the number of samples is not explicitly mentioned, so I answered "NA" (Not Available).
* For question 4, 5, and 6, there is no mention of BPH, perineural growth, or atypia in the text, so I answered "NA" (Not Available).
