Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "10mm, 7mm, 15mm, 10mm",
  "Gleason_score": "3+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "kyll채",
  "atypia": "kyll채"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: 4, since there are 4 fragments mentioned in the report (2 from the left side and 2 from the right side).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the fragments are listed in millimeters.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as 3+4, which is a combination of the primary and secondary patterns.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei" (no), since the report mentions malignant features.
* `perineural_invasion`: "kyll채" (yes), since the report mentions growth around nerves.
* `atypia`: "kyll채" (yes), since the report mentions malignant cells.
