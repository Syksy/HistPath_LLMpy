Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples taken is 9, based on the description of the samples (A-C, D-E, F-G, H-I).
2. The size of the samples is not specified in the report, so I marked it as "NA" (not available).
3. The Gleason score is 3+4=7, based on the description of the dominant Gleason pattern (3) and the secondary pattern (4).
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the report, so I marked it as "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I marked it as "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I marked it as "ei" (no).
