Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "(9)",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "(NA)",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "(3+4=7)",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "(ei)",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "(ei)",
  "6. Atypia": "(ei)"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples taken is 9, based on the description of the apex samples A-C, two macroscopic samples from the base D-E, F-G basis, and H-I two samples from seminal vesicles.
2. The size of the samples is not specified in the report, so I marked it as NA (not available).
3. The Gleason score is 3+4=7, based on the dominant Gleason grade 3 and Gleason grade 4 differentiation almost equally.
4. There is no evidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the sample, so I marked it as "ei" (no).
5. There is no evidence of perineural invasion in the sample, so I marked it as "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I marked it as "ei" (no).
