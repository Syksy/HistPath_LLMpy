Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "4+6+3mm, 5+7+8mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 6, as there are 3 samples from the left and 3 samples from the right.
* The size of the samples is given as 4+6+3mm and 5+7+8mm, but it's not clear which size corresponds to which sample.
* The Gleason score, BPH detection, perineural growth detection, and atypia detection are all marked as "NA" (Not Available) since this information is not present in the given text.
