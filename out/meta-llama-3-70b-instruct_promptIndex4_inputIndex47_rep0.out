Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["10 mm", "7 mm", "15 mm", "10 mm"],
  "Gleason_score": 3,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: There are 4 samples in total, 2 from the left side and 2 from the right side.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the samples are 10 mm, 7 mm, 15 mm, and 10 mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The main Gleason score is 3, with type 4 being the second most common.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This is false, as there are malignant cells present in the samples.
* `perineural_invasion`: This is true, as growth around nerves is mentioned in the report.
* `atypia`: This is true, as low-differentiated carcinoma cells are present, which are atypical compared to normal tissue.
