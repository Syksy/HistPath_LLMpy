Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 2,
  "sample_size_or_weight": {"right": "60mm", "left": "80mm"},
  "Gleason_score": {"primary": 4, "secondary": 5, "total": 9},
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions two samples, one from the right and one from the left.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the samples are given as 60mm for the right sample and 80mm for the left sample.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as 9 (4+5), so I broke it down into primary, secondary, and total scores.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since the report mentions carcinoma, this is set to false.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These values are not mentioned in the report, so I returned NA (Not Available) instead of making an uncertain assumption.
