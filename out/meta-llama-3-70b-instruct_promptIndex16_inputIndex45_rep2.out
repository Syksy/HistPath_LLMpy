Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "6",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "ei",
  "6. Atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has 6 biopsies (Samples 1-6).
2. The size of the biopsies is not specified in the report, so the answer is NA (Not Available).
3. There is no Gleason score mentioned in the report, so the answer is NA.
4. The report states that the samples are benign, so there is no evidence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) or carcinoma, which means no high-grade prostatic liikakasvu.
5. There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so the answer is ei (no).
6. The report explicitly states that no significant atypia is observed in the gland epithelia, so the answer is ei (no).
