I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text is a poem and not a medical report. It does not contain any information about a patient's biopsy or medical condition.

Therefore, I will answer each question with 'NA' (Not Available) since there is no relevant information in the provided text.

Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "Näytteiden määrä": "NA",
  "Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "NA",
  "Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "Atypia": "NA"
}
```

If you meant to provide a different text, please feel free to share it, and I'll be happy to assist you.
