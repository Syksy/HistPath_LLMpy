Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1, // Assuming 4g of tissue is one sample
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is assumed to be 1, as the text mentions 4g of tissue, but it's not clear if this is one or multiple samples.
* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA.
* The report suggests that the findings are consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia, so `benign_hyperplasia_only` is set to true.
* There is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the report, so these values are marked as NA.
