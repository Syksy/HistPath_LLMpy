Here are the answers to the questions based on the provided medical note:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 9,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7/7/NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples is 9, as there are 3 samples from the apex (A-C), 2 macro samples from the base (D-E), 2 samples from the base (F-G), and 2 samples from the seminal vesicles (H-I).
2. The size of the samples is not specified in the note, so it's marked as "NA" (not available).
3. The Gleason score is reported as 3+4=7, with the major component being Gleason 3 and the minor component being Gleason 4.
4. There is no mention of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the note, so it's marked as "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the note, so it's marked as "NA" (not available).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the note, so it's marked as "ei" (no).
