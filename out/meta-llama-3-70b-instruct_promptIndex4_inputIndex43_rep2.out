Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "19g",
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary_pattern": 5,
    "secondary_pattern": 4
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is assumed to be 1, as the report does not explicitly mention multiple samples.
* The sample size or weight is reported as 19g, which is the total weight of the prostate shavings.
* The Gleason score is reported with a primary pattern of 5 and a secondary pattern of 4.
* Benign hyperplasia only is set to false, as the report mentions a malignant growth.
* Perineural invasion and atypia are marked as NA (Not Available), as they are not mentioned in the report.
