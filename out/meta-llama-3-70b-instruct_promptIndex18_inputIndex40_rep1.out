Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 14,
  "2. Size of samples": "macrosections",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+3=7/7/NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "kyllä",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 14, as there are samples A-D, E-F, and G-N, which makes a total of 14 samples.
* The size of samples is mentioned as "macrosections", which means the samples are taken as larger sections.
* The Gleason score is reported as 4+3=7, where 4 is the prevailing class and 3 is the minor class.
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not mentioned in the text, so it's assumed to be "ei" (no).
* Perineural growth is mentioned as "abundantly observed", so it's "kyllä" (yes).
* Atypia is not mentioned in the text, so it's "NA" (not available).
