Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 12,
  "2. Size of samples": "150 mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "yes",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is explicitly mentioned as 12.
* The size of the samples is given as 150 mm.
* There is no mention of the Gleason score, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) can be detected, as the text mentions "some undulating hyperplastic-like epithelium".
* There is no mention of perineural growth or atypia, so they are marked as NA.
