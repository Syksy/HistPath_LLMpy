Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "no"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions "Samples 1-6", so there are 6 samples taken.
2. There is no information about the size of the samples, so it's "NA".
3. There is no mention of Gleason score, so it's "NA".
4. There is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia), so it's "NA".
5. There is no mention of perineural growth, so it's "NA".
6. The text explicitly states "No significant atypia is observed", so atypia detection is "no".
