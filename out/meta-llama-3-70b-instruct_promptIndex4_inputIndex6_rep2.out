Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The report mentions multiple samples (e.g., D-G apex, basis, seminaalivehikkeleit√§ O-Q), but it's not clear how many individual samples were taken. Therefore, I've assumed a single sample was taken, but this might not be accurate.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: There is no information about the size or weight of the samples in the report, so I've marked it as NA (not available).
* `Gleason_score`: The report explicitly states that the tumor is Gleason 7-tasoista karsinoomaa.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions a tumor, which implies that it's not just benign hyperplasia, so I've marked this as false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've marked this as false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I've marked this as false.
