Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["10mm", "8mm", "14mm", "14mm"],
  "Gleason_score": 3,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: There are 4 samples mentioned in the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the samples are listed as an array.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as 3, with a breakdown of 90% Gleason 3 and 10% Gleason 4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This is set to `false` because adenocarcinoma is seen in sample 4.
* `perineural_invasion`: This is set to `false` because the report explicitly states that perineural invasion is not seen in the samples.
* `atypia`: This is set to `NA` because there is no mention of atypia in the report.
