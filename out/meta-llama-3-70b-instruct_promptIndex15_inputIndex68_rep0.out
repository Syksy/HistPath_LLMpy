I apologize, but the text you provided appears to be a physics problem and not a histopathological report. It does not contain any information about a patient's biopsy sample. Therefore, I cannot provide answers to the questions you asked.

If you could provide the actual histopathological report, I would be happy to help you extract the information you need.
