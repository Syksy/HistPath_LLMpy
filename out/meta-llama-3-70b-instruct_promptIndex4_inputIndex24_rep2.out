Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 8,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: 8, as the report mentions that the prostate electresektions were started in 8 blocks.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, as the report does not provide information about the size or weight of the samples.
* `Gleason_score`: NA, as the report does not mention the Gleason score.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: true, as the report concludes that the finding is benign.
* `perineural_invasion`: false, as there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: false, as there is no mention of atypia in the report.
