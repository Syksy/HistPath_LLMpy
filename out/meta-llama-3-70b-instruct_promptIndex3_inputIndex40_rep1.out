Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 14,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+3=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "yes",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 14 because there are samples A-D, E-F, and G-N, which makes a total of 14 samples.
* The size of samples is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as "NA" (Not Available).
* The Gleason score is reported as class 4 prevailing and some class 3, so the sum is 4+3=7.
* There is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) or atypia in the text, so they are marked as "NA".
* Perineural invasion is mentioned as abundantly observed, so it's marked as "yes".
