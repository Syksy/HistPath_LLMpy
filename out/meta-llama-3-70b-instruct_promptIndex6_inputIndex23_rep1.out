Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"sample": 1, "size": "8+6mm"},
    {"sample": 2, "size": "10mm"},
    {"sample": 3, "size": "5+5mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": [
    {"sample": 1, "Gleason_score": 7, "Gleason_3": 60, "Gleason_4": 40},
    {"sample": 2, "Gleason_score": 7, "Gleason_3": 70, "Gleason_4": 30},
    {"sample": 3, "Gleason_score": NA}
  ],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Note: 

* `sample_count` is the number of samples taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight` is an array of objects, each containing the sample number and its corresponding size or weight.
* `Gleason_score` is an array of objects, each containing the sample number, Gleason score, and the percentage of Gleason 3 and 4 patterns.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only` is a boolean indicating whether the sample shows only benign hyperplasia (false in this case).
* `perineural_invasion` is NA (not available) since it is not mentioned in the original report.
* `atypia` is true since PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) changes are mentioned in the report, which are a type of atypia.
