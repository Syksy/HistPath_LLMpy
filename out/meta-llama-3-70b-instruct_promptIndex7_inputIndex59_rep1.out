Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30mm",
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 3, because the report mentions "Three fusion biopsies".
* "sample_size_or_weight": "30mm", because the report mentions the total length of the biopsies as 30mm.
* "Gleason_score": 7, because the report mentions a score of 7.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions carcinoma foci, indicating that the sample is not only benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion" and "atypia": NA, because the report does not mention these specific features.
