Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 3,
  "2. Size of samples": "90mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyllä",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text states "Samples of 3 prostatic core needle biopsies", so the number of samples is 3.
2. The total length of the samples is 90mm.
3. There is no mention of Gleason score in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
4. The text mentions "glandular structures, which would perhaps indicate hyperplasia", which suggests that BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) can be detected, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
6. The text states "no atypia or findings suggestive of malignancy", so the answer is "ei" (no).
