Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* "sample_count": 12, because the report mentions 12 needle biopsies.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm", because the report mentions the total length of the samples is approximately 150mm.
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention the Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": true, because the report concludes that the growth is benign and similar to hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": false, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
