Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("4"),
  "2. Sample sizes": ("10mm, 8mm, 14mm, 14mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("3+4=7/90%/10%"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural invasion": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Let me explain each answer:

1. The patient has 4 samples taken.
2. The sample sizes are 10mm, 8mm, 14mm, and 14mm.
3. The Gleason score is 3+4=7, with 90% of the glands forming glandular structures (Gleason 3) and 10% forming glands (Gleason 4).
4. There is no benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) seen in the samples.
5. There is no perineural invasion seen in the samples.
6. There is no atypia seen in the samples.
