Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "(a. Näytteiden määrä)": 6,
  "(b. Näytteiden koko)": "NA",
  "(c. Gleason-luokitus)": "4+3=7",
  "(d. Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu)": "ei",
  "(e. Perineuraalinen kasvu)": "NA",
  "(f. Atypia)": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* For question b, the size of the samples is not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I answered "NA".
* For question d, since the text mentions "huonosti erilaistunutta" (poorly differentiated) cancer, it implies that the growth is not well-differentiated, which is not considered "hyvälaatuinen" (well-differentiated).
* For questions e and f, there is no mention of perineural growth or atypia in the text, so I answered "NA".
