Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "(4)",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "[(10mm), (8mm), (14mm), (14mm)]",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "(3+4=7)",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "('ei')",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "('ei')",
  "6. Atypia": "('NA')"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has 4 biopsy samples.
2. The sizes of the biopsy samples are 10mm, 8mm, 14mm, and 14mm.
3. The Gleason score is 3+4=7, which indicates a moderate-grade cancer.
4. There is no benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the sample, so the answer is 'ei' (no).
5. There is no perineural invasion in the sample, so the answer is 'ei' (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the sample, so the answer is 'NA' (not applicable).
