I apologize, but the provided text does not appear to be a histopathological prostate cancer sample statement. The text seems to be a passage from a science fiction or fantasy story, and it does not contain any relevant information about a prostate cancer sample.

If you could provide the actual histopathological prostate cancer sample statement in Finnish, I would be happy to help you extract the necessary information.

However, based on the provided text, I can only give the following answers:

{
"1. Number of samples": "NA",
"2. Size of samples": "NA",
"3. Gleason score": "NA",
"4. BPH detection": "NA",
"5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
"6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}

Please provide the actual sample statement, and I'll do my best to assist you.
