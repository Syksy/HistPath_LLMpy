After analyzing the provided histopathological report, I'll do my best to extract the relevant information and convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here's the result:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": "9",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia_present": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: No information found in the report, so I returned `NA`.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: No information found in the report, so I returned `NA`.
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions "1+2=9", which suggests a Gleason score of 9.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: No information found in the report, so I returned `NA`.
* `perineural_invasion`: No information found in the report, so I returned `NA`.
* `atypia_present`: No information found in the report, so I returned `NA`.

Please note that the report seems to be incomplete or lacks specific details, which is why many fields are marked as `NA`. If you have any further questions or would like me to clarify anything, feel free to ask!
