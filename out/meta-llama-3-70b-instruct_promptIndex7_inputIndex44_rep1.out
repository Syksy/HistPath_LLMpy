Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["10mm", "8mm", "14mm", "14mm"],
  "Gleason_score": 3,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 4, because there are 4 samples mentioned in the report.
* "sample_size_or_weight": an array of sizes, because each sample has a different size.
* "Gleason_score": 3, because the report mentions Gleason 3 as the primary score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions adenocarcinoma in sample 4.
* "perineural_invasion": false, because the report explicitly states that perineural invasion is not seen in the samples.
* "atypia": NA, because the report does not mention atypia at all.
