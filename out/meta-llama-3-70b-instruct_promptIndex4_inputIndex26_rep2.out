Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: 12, as there are 12 needle biopsies taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: "150mm", which is the total length of the samples.
