Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["5mm", "10mm"], // multiple values, not sure which one to choose
  "Gleason_score": [8, 7, 7], // multiple values, one for each sample
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": null, // not mentioned in the report
  "atypia": true
}
```

Note: 

* `number_of_samples` is 6, as there are six biopsialieriötä (biopsy samples) mentioned in the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight` has multiple values, as there are different sizes mentioned for different samples. It's not clear which one to choose, so I've included both.
* `Gleason_score` also has multiple values, one for each sample.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only` is false, as there are malignant findings (adenokarsinooma) in addition to hyperplastic changes.
* `perineural_invasion` is null, as it's not mentioned in the report.
* `atypia` is true, as there are atypical glandular structures mentioned in the report.
