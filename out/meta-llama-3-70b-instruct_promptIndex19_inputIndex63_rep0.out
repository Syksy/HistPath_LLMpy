Based on the provided medical note, I'll extract the information and provide the answers in JSON format. Please note that since this is a medical note from an emergency department and not a pathology report, some of the questions may not be applicable.

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": "NA",
  "2. Size of samples taken": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score of the samples": "NA",
  "4. Can BPH be detected in the samples taken?": "NA",
  "5. Can perineural growth be detected in the samples taken?": "NA",
  "6. Can atypia be detected in the samples taken?": "NA"
}
```

The reason for the "NA" (Not Applicable) answers is that the provided medical note does not contain any information about samples, their size, or any pathology-related findings, including Gleason score, BPH, perineural growth, or atypia. The note appears to be a description of a patient's emergency department visit and treatment for a shoulder luxation injury.
