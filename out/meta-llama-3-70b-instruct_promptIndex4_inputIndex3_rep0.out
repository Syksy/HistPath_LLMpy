Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 2,
  "sample_size_or_weight": {"right": "60mm", "left": "80mm"},
  "Gleason_score": {"primary": 4, "secondary": 5, "total": 9},
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

* `number_of_samples`: There are two samples mentioned in the report, one from the right side and one from the left side.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the samples are given as 60mm for the right side and 80mm for the left side.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as 9 (4+5), with a primary score of 4 and a secondary score of 5.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This is set to false because the report mentions carcinoma (cancer) in sample B.
