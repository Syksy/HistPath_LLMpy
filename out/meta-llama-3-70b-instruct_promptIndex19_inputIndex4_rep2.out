Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "150mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "kyllä"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions "prostatabiopsioat" which is a plural form, but it's clear that only one sample is being described, so the answer is 1.
2. The text states "kokonaispituus n. 150mm" which means the total length of the sample is approximately 150mm.
3. There is no mention of Gleason score in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
4. The text does not mention BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia), and the description of the sample is more consistent with adenocarcinoma, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
6. The text mentions "tuma-atypiaa" which means nuclear atypia, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
