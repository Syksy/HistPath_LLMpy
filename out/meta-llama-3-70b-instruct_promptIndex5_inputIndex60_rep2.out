I'm happy to help!

Since the provided text "Beep boop? Boop biip. Blarp!" doesn't seem to contain any relevant information about a histopathological report, I'll assume it's a placeholder or an invalid input.

If you could provide a real histopathological report, I'd be happy to help you convert it into a structured format in JSON. Please paste the actual report, and I'll do my best to extract the relevant information and provide it in the following format:

```
{
  "sample_count": <number>,
  "sample_size_or_weight": <value>,
  "gleason_score": <value>,
  "benign_hyperplasia": <boolean>,
  "perineural_invasion": <boolean>,
  "atypia": <boolean>
}
```

If any of the values are missing from the report, I'll replace them with "NA" (Not Available).
