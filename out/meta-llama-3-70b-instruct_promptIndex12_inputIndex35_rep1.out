Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "NA",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "5g",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "4+? = 8",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. Näytteiden määrä: The report doesn't mention the number of samples taken, so the answer is "NA".
2. Näytteiden koko: The report mentions that "about 5g of prostate shavings" were taken, so the answer is "5g".
3. Gleason-luokitus: The report mentions that the most representative Gleason score is 4, and the total score is 8, so the answer is "4+? = 8".
4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu: The report doesn't mention anything about benign prostatic hyperplasia, and it actually confirms the suspicion of adenocarcinoma, so the answer is "ei".
5. Perineuraalinen kasvu: The report doesn't mention anything about perineural growth, so the answer is "NA".
6. Atypia: The report doesn't mention anything about atypia, so the answer is "NA".
