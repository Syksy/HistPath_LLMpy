Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 3,
  "2. Size of samples": "90mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyllä",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text states "Näytteitä 3 prostatan paksuneulabiopsioita", which means there are 3 prostate biopsy samples.
2. The text states "Näytteiden yhteispituus 90mm", which means the total length of the samples is 90mm.
3. There is no mention of the Gleason score in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
4. The text mentions "hyperplasiaan", which suggests that BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) can be detected in the samples, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
6. The text states "ei atypiaa", which means there is no atypia detected in the samples, so the answer is "ei" (no).
