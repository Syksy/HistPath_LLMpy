I'll go through the questions one by one and provide the answers in JSON format.

**1. Näytteiden määrä:**
```
{
  "näytteiden_määrä": 6
}
```
The report mentions that there are 3 samples from the left side and 3 samples from the right side, making a total of 6 samples.

**2. Näytteiden koko:**
```
{
  "näytteiden_koko": {
    "left": "4+6+3 mm",
    "right": "5+7+8 mm"
  }
}
```
The report mentions the size of each sample, but not a single overall size. I've provided the sizes for each side separately.

Let me know when you're ready for me to proceed with the next questions!
