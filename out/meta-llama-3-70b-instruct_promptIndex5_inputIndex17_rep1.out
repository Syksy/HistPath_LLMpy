Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size": [
    {"side": "left", "size": "10mm"},
    {"side": "left", "size": "7mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "15mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "10mm"}
  ],
  "gleason_score": {"primary": 3, "secondary": 4},
  "benign_hyperplasia": true,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 4 in this case.
* `sample_size`: An array of objects, each describing the size of a sample. The `side` field indicates whether the sample is from the left or right side of the prostate.
* `gleason_score`: An object with two fields, `primary` and `secondary`, which represent the primary and secondary Gleason scores, respectively.
* `benign_hyperplasia`: A boolean indicating whether the sample shows benign hyperplasia, which is true in this case.
* `perineural_invasion`: A boolean indicating whether the sample shows perineural invasion, which is true in this case.
* `atypia`: A field indicating whether the sample shows atypia, which is not mentioned in the report, so it is set to NA (Not Available).
