Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 4,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+3=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The size of the samples is not mentioned, so it's marked as "NA".
* The Gleason score is reported as grade 4 being the most prevalent and grade 3 being almost as large a percentage, so I've combined them as 4+3=7.
* There is no mention of BPH, perineural growth, or atypia in the sample statement, so they are all marked as "NA".
