Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30mm",
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 3 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total length of the biopsies, which is 30mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the carcinoma, which is 7 (with a breakdown of approximately 2/3 grade 3 and 1/3 grade 4).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia. In this case, since carcinoma foci are present, the value is set to `false`.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are marked as `NA` (Not Available) since there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the original report.
