Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("9"),
  "2. Size of the samples taken": ("NA"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("3+4=7"),
  "4. Is there benign prostatic hyperplasia?": ("ei"),
  "5. Is there perineural growth?": ("NA"),
  "6. Is there atypia?": ("NA")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples taken is 9, as mentioned in the text: "Apex to samples A-C, two macrosections per base D-E, F-G base and H-I two samples from seminal vesicles."
2. The size of the samples taken is not specified in the text, so I marked it as "NA" (not available).
3. The Gleason score is 3+4=7, based on the text: "The largest tumor focus is on the side of the base, where the prevailing Gleason grade 3 and grade 4 differentiation is almost equal."
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia in the text, so I marked it as "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so I marked it as "NA" (not available).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so I marked it as "NA" (not available).
