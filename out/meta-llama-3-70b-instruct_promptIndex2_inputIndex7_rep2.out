Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": ("6"),
  "2. Näytteiden koko": ("n. 120mm"),
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": ("NA"),
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": ("NA"),
  "6. Atypia": ("kyllä")
}
```

Note: 

* For question 3, the Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so I answered "NA" (not available).
* For question 4, there is no mention of benign hyperplasia, but rather basaalisoluhyperplasia, which is not the same thing. Basaalisoluhyperplasia is a type of cellular change that can be seen in prostate tissue, but it's not necessarily a benign condition.
* For question 5, there is no mention of perineural growth, so I answered "NA".
* For question 6, atypia is implied by the phrase "basalisoluhyperplasiaa", which suggests some kind of abnormal cellular change.
