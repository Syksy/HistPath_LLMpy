Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 14,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+3=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "yes",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples is 14, as mentioned in the text: A-D, E-F, G-N, and N-O.
2. The size of the samples is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as "NA" (not available).
3. The Gleason score is mentioned as having a prevailing class of 4 and some class 3, so the score is 4+3=7.
4. There is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) in the text, so it's marked as "NA".
5. Perineural invasion is mentioned as being "abundantly observed", so it's marked as "yes".
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so it's marked as "NA".
