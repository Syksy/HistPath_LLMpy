Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "2mm (sample 2)",
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary": 4,
    "secondary": 3
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 4 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample, which is only available for sample 2 (2mm).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is a grading system used to evaluate the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. In this case, the primary Gleason score is 4, and the secondary score is 3.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., non-cancerous growth). Since the report mentions adenocarcinoma, this field is set to `false`.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are marked as `NA` (Not Available) since there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the provided report.
