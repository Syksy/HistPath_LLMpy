Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 8,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions that the sampled prostate electrosection chips have been started in eight blocks, so I assume this refers to the number of samples taken.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: There is no information about the size or weight of the samples, so I return NA.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I return NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report states that the finding is benign, and there is no indication of malignancy, so I assume this refers to benign hyperplasia only.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I return false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I return false.

Note that I've returned NA for fields where the information is not available in the report, rather than making assumptions or returning incorrect values.
