Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": "kyllä"
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: Since the report mentions multiple samples (e.g., "In sample 1B"), but it's not clear how many, I assumed it's at least one. If you want to be more conservative, you could set this to NA.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions the total length of the samples as approximately 150mm.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I set it to NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions adenocarcinoma, which implies that it's not just benign hyperplasia, so I set this to "ei".
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I set it to NA.
* `atypia`: The report mentions nuclear atypia, so I set this to "kyllä".
