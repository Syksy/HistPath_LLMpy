Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": "NA",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "kyllä"
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 1, because the report mentions "sample 1B" and does not indicate multiple biopsies.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm", because the report mentions the total length of the sample as approximately 150mm.
* "Gleason_score": "NA", because the report does not mention a Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei", because the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor.
* "perineural_invasion": "ei", because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": "kyllä", because the report mentions nuclear atypia.
