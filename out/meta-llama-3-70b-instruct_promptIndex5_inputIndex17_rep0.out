Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"side": "left", "size": "10mm"},
    {"side": "left", "size": "7mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "15mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "10mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary_pattern": 3,
    "secondary_pattern": 4
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia_present": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 4 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: An array of objects describing the size of each sample. In this case, we have four samples with sizes ranging from 7mm to 15mm.
* `Gleason_score`: An object describing the Gleason score, which is a measure of the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. The primary pattern is 3, and the secondary pattern is 4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample shows only benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, it's false because cancer is present.
* `perineural_invasion`: A boolean indicating whether perineural invasion (i.e., cancer growth around nerves) is present. In this case, it's true.
* `atypia_present`: A value indicating whether atypia (i.e., abnormal cell changes) is present. Since this information is not mentioned in the original report, I've marked it as NA (not available).
