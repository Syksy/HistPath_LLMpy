I'm happy to help!

After analyzing the provided text, I'll do my best to extract the relevant information and convert it into a structured format in JSON.

Here's the result:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain any relevant information related to the questions asked. Therefore, I had to return NA (Not Available) for all fields.

If you could provide a more relevant histopathological report, I'd be happy to help you extract the necessary information!
