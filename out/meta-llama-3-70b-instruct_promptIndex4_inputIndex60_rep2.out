I'm happy to help!

After analyzing the provided histopathological report, I must conclude that it doesn't contain any relevant information. The text appears to be a sequence of nonsensical words and doesn't provide any meaningful data.

Therefore, I will return a JSON-formatted response with NA (Not Available) values for each of the requested fields:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": "NA",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": "NA",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "NA",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Please provide a valid histopathological report, and I'll be happy to assist you in extracting the relevant information!
