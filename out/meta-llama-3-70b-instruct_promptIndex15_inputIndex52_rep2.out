Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("9"),
  "2. Sample size": ("macrosections"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("3+4=7/7/NA"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples is 9, as mentioned in the text: "Apex to samples A-C, two macrosections per base D-E, F-G base and H-I two samples from seminal vesicles."
2. The sample size is described as macrosections, which is a type of tissue sample.
3. The Gleason score is 3+4=7, as mentioned in the text: "The prevailing Gleason grade 3 and grade 4 differentiation is almost equal."
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the text, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so the answer is "ei" (no).
