Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 12,
  "2. Size of samples": "150mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyll채",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text states "12 edustavaa neulabiopsiaa", which means 12 representative needle biopsies, so the number of samples is 12.
2. The text states "N채ytteiden yhteispituus on noin 150mm", which means the total length of the samples is approximately 150mm.
3. There is no mention of Gleason score in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
4. The text mentions "jonkin verran aaltoilevaa hyperplastisen kaltaista epiteeli채", which suggests the presence of benign hyperplastic-like epithelium, which is consistent with BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia). Therefore, the answer is "kyll채" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
6. The text does not mention atypia, and the overall impression is of benign growth, so the answer is "ei" (no).
