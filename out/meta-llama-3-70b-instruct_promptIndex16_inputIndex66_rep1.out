I apologize, but the provided text is a poem and does not contain any information about a pathology report or a patient's sample. It appears to be a personal and emotional reflection on loss and grief.

As a result, I cannot provide answers to the questions you've asked, as there is no relevant information in the text. If you could provide an actual pathology report or a relevant medical document, I would be happy to assist you in extracting the necessary information.

Here is the response in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "NA",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "NA",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "NA"
}
```

Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!
