Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of biopsy samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Since the report doesn't mention the size or weight of the samples, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The report doesn't mention the Gleason score, so I've marked it as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report states that the samples show benign prostate tissue, so this field is set to true.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report doesn't mention perineural invasion, so this field is set to false.
* `atypia`: The report explicitly states that no atypia is seen in the samples, so this field is set to false.
