b. The total length of the samples is approximately 150mm, but it's not clear how many samples there are or their individual lengths, so the answer is 150.

d. The report does not mention any benign prostatic hyperplasia, so the answer is "ei".

e. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is "NA".

f. The report mentions nuclear atypia, so the answer is "kyllä".
