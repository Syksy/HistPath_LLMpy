Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 14,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": "4, 3",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: 14 samples were taken from the patient (A-D, E-F, G-N, and N-O).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the samples is not specified in the report, so it's marked as "NA" (not available).
* `Gleason_score`: The prevailing Gleason class is 4, and there is also some class 3.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This is set to `false` because the report mentions clear foci and tumor infiltration, indicating that the sample is not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: This is set to `true` because the report explicitly states that perineural invasion is abundantly observed.
* `atypia`: This is set to `false` because there is no mention of atypia in the report.
