Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 14,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary": 4,
    "secondary": 3
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 14 in this case (A-D, E-F, G-N, and N-O).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Since the report doesn't mention the size or weight of the samples, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as having a primary class of 4 and a secondary class of 3.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, since the report mentions clear foci with Gleason classes, it's set to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly states that perineural invasion is abundantly observed, so this field is set to true.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I've marked it as NA.
