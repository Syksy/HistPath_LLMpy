Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("3"),
  "2. Size of the samples": ("30mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("7 (3+4)"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia found": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural growth found": ("NA"),
  "6. Atypia found": ("NA")
}
```

Note: 

* For question 4, I answered "ei" (no) because the report mentions carcinoma foci, which indicates malignant growth, not benign prostatic hyperplasia.
* For questions 5 and 6, I answered "NA" (not available) because the report does not mention perineural growth or atypia.
