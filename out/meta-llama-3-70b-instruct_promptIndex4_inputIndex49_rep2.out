Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "12.3g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: Since the report doesn't explicitly mention the number of samples, I assume it's 1 based on the context.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions the total weight of the chips as 12.3g.
* `Gleason_score`: Since there is no mention of Gleason score in the report, I return NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report suggests that the specimens show stromal hyperplasia, which is a benign condition, and there is no direct suggestion of malignancy.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I return false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia or any abnormal changes in the report, so I return false.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to clarify any of these points!
