Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 8,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "13g",
  "Gleason_score": 6,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 8 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the samples, which is 13g in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the sample, which is 6 (3+3) in this case.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia. In this case, it's false because the report mentions carcinoma.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are marked as NA (Not Available) because the report does not mention anything about perineural invasion or atypia.
