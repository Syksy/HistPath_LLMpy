Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12, // assuming 12 samples based on the mention of specimens D-G and K-P
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA, // no information available
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, // since carcinoma is mentioned
  "perineural_invasion": NA, // no information available
  "atypia": NA // no information available
}
```

Note that I had to make an assumption about the number of samples based on the mention of specimens D-G and K-P. If this assumption is incorrect, please let me know and I'll update the response accordingly. Additionally, I returned NA (Not Available) for sample size or weight, perineural invasion, and atypia since these details are not mentioned in the report.
