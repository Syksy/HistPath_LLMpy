Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 9,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary_grade": 3,
    "secondary_grade": 4
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 9 in this case (A-C, D-E, F-G, H-I).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Not mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as a combination of primary and secondary grades, which are both 3 and 4 in this case.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since the report mentions a large tumor, this field is set to false, indicating that the sample is not only benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: Not explicitly mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as NA.
* `atypia`: Not mentioned in the report, and since there is no indication of atypical changes, I've set this field to false.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to clarify any of these fields!
