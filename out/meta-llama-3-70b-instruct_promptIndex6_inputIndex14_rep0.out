Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"sample": 1, "size_or_weight": "10mm"},
    {"sample": 2, "size_or_weight": "8mm"},
    {"sample": 3, "size_or_weight": "14mm"},
    {"sample": 4, "size_or_weight": "14mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": {"sample": 4, "score": "3+4"},
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Note: I assumed that the Gleason score is reported as a sum of two scores (3+4) as it is commonly done. If you need a different format, please let me know. Also, I reported "atypia" as NA since it was not mentioned in the original report.
