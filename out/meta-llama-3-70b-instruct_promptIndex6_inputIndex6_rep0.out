Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: The report mentions multiple samples (D-G apex, basis K-P, seminaalivehikkeleit√§ O-Q), but it's not clear how many individual samples were taken. Therefore, I've assumed a single sample with multiple fragments.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: There is no information about the size or weight of the samples, so I've returned NA.
* `Gleason_score`: The report explicitly states that the tumor is Gleason score 7.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions a tumor and provides a Gleason score, indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia. Therefore, I've set this to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've set this to false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I've set this to false.
