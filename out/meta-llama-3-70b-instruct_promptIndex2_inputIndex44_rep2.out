Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("4"),
  "2. Sample size": ("10mm, 8mm, 14mm, 14mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("3+4=7"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural invasion": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("NA")
}
```

Note: 

* For question 4, I assumed that "hyv√§laatuista eturauhasen liikakasvua" refers to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is not mentioned in the report.
* For question 6, I answered "NA" since atypia is not mentioned in the report.
