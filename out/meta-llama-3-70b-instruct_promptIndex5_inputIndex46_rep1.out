Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "macrosections",
  "Gleason_score": "4+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the samples, which is described as "macrosections" in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the sample, which is 4+4 in this case.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, it's false because adenocarcinoma was found.
* `perineural_invasion`: A boolean indicating whether perineural invasion (i.e., cancer growth around nerves) was found. In this case, it's false because there's no mention of it in the report.
* `atypia`: A boolean indicating whether atypia (i.e., abnormal cell changes) was found. In this case, it's false because there's no mention of it in the report.
