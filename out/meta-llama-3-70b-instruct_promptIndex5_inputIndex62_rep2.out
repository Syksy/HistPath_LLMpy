I'll do my best to extract the relevant information from the given text and convert it into a structured format in JSON.

Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

As you can see, all the values are marked as "NA" (Not Available) because the input text does not contain any relevant information about the biopsy or prostate tissue sample. The text appears to be a test sentence with fictional and humorous content, rather than an actual histopathological report.
