Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "10 mm, 7 mm, 15 mm, 10 mm",
  "Gleason_score": 3+4,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 4, because there are 4 fragments mentioned in the report (2 from the left side and 2 from the right side).
* "sample_size_or_weight": "10 mm, 7 mm, 15 mm, 10 mm", because the sizes of the fragments are mentioned in the report.
* "Gleason_score": 3+4, because the report mentions that Gleason type 3 is the main rule and type 4 is the second most common.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions carcinoma cells, which indicates malignancy.
* "perineural_invasion": true, because the report mentions growth around nerves.
* "atypia": NA, because there is no mention of atypia in the report.
