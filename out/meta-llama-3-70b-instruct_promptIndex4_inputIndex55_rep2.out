Based on the provided histopathological report, I will extract the relevant information and convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary_grade": 4,
    "secondary_grade": 3
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 4 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Since the report doesn't mention the size or weight of the samples, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as having a primary grade of 4 and a secondary grade of 3.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor, this field is set to false.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are marked as NA since there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the report.
