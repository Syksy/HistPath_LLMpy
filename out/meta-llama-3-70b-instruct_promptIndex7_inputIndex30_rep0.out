Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "100mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia_present": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: Since the report mentions a single sample, I assume it's one sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions a total length of 100mm, so I use that as the sample size/weight.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I return NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions suspicious malignancy, so it's not just benign hyperplasia. I return false.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly mentions perineural growth, which is suspicious for malignancy. I return true.
* `atypia_present`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I return false.
