It seems like there's an error in the SQL query, and the query parameters are not found. Unfortunately, this means that I won't be able to extract the information from the histopathological report.

Here are the answers in JSON format, with "NA" indicating that the information is not available due to the error:

```
{
  "sample_count": "NA",
  "sample_amount": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA",
  "patient_bph": "NA",
  "sample_perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "sample_atypia": "NA"
}
```

If you could provide the correct histopathological report or fix the SQL query, I'd be happy to help you extract the information!
