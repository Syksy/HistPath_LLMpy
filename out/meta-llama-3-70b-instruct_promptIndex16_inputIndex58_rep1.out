Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("6"),
  "2. Sample size": ("NA"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("4+3=7"),
  "4. Well-differentiated prostate cancer": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural invasion": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has 6 biopsy samples (1 base right, 2 center right, 3 apex right, 4 base left, 5 center left, and 6 apex left).
2. The size of the samples is not specified in the report, so I marked it as "NA" (not available).
3. The Gleason score is 4+3=7, which indicates a moderately to poorly differentiated prostate cancer.
4. There is no mention of well-differentiated prostate cancer in the report, so I marked it as "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I marked it as "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I marked it as "ei" (no).
