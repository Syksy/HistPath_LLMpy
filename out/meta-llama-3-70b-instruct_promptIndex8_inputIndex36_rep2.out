Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1, // koko elin yhtenä näytteenä
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": "3+4=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Note: Since the original text does not mention the number of biopsies or the weight/size of the samples, I have assumed it to be a single sample (the entire prostate) and marked the size/weight as NA.
