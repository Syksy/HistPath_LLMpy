Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"sample": "Right base", "size": "8mm"},
    {"sample": "Right base", "size": "7mm"},
    {"sample": "Left base", "size": "5mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": 3,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 12 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: An array of objects, each containing the size of a biopsy sample. Note that not all samples have a reported size, so only the ones with available information are included.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the cancerous tissue, which is 3 in this case.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, it's false because cancer was detected.
* `perineural_invasion`: Since there is no mention of perineural invasion in the original report, the value is set to NA (not available).
* `atypia`: A boolean indicating whether atypia (abnormal cell changes) was detected. In this case, it's false because the report explicitly states that no atypia was found.
