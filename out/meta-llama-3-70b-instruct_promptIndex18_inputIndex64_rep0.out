I apologize, but the provided text is not a medical note written by a pathologist in Finnish. It appears to be an error message related to a SQL query.

As a result, I cannot extract the requested information from the text. The answers to the questions would be:

{
"1. How many samples have been taken?": NA,
"2. What is the size of the samples taken?": NA,
"3. What is the Gleason score of the samples?": NA,
"4. Can BPH be detected in the samples taken?": NA,
"5. Can perineural growth be detected in the samples taken?": NA,
"6. Can atypia be detected in the samples taken?": NA
}

Please provide a valid medical note in Finnish, and I'll be happy to assist you in extracting the requested information.
