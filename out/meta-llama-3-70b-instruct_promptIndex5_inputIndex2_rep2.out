Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "90mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 3 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total length of the samples, which is 90mm.
* `Gleason_score`: Not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: True, because the report mentions that one of the samples contains stroma and glandular structures, which may indicate hyperplasia, and there are no malignant findings.
* `perineural_invasion`: False, because there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: False, because the report explicitly states that there is no atypia or malignant findings.
