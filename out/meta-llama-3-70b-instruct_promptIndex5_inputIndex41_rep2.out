Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 13,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "about 180mm",
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary_pattern": 3,
    "secondary_pattern": 4,
    "percentage_of_secondary_pattern": 30
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": null,
  "atypia": null
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 13 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the material examined, which is approximately 180mm.
* `Gleason_score`: An object containing the Gleason score information. In this case, the primary pattern is 3, and the secondary pattern is 4, with the latter accounting for about 30% of the tumor found.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, it's false because carcinoma was found in some biopsies.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are null because there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the original report.
