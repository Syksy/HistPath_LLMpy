Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "12.3g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient is not explicitly mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions that the sample contains 12.3g of chips, which I've recorded as the sample size or weight.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I've marked it as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report suggests that the specimens show stromal hyperplasia, which is a benign condition, and there is no direct suggestion of malignancy. Therefore, I've marked this field as true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've marked it as false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I've marked it as false.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to process more reports!
