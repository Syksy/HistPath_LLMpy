Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "150mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "kyllä"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is assumed to be 1, as the text only mentions one sample (1B).
* The size of the samples is 150mm.
* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not mentioned in the text, so it's assumed to be not detected (ei).
* Perineural growth is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
* Atypia is mentioned in the text as "tuma-atypiaa", so it's marked as detected (kyllä).
