Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["5mm", "10mm", NA, NA, NA, NA],
  "Gleason_score": [8, 7, 7, NA, NA, NA],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of biopsy samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of each sample. Only two samples have a specified size (5mm and 10mm), so the rest are marked as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score for each sample. Only three samples have a specified Gleason score (8, 7, and 7), so the rest are marked as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia. In this case, it's false because some samples show adenocarcinoma.
* `perineural_invasion`: A boolean indicating whether perineural invasion is present. Since it's not mentioned in the report, it's marked as NA.
* `atypia`: A boolean indicating whether atypia is present. In this case, it's true because some samples show atypia.
