Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "4+6+3 mm and 5+7+8 mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "kyll√§" (note: this is likely referring to the "maligniin viittaavaa kasvua" mentioned in the text, which suggests malignant growth, but not specifically atypia)
}
```

Note: The Gleason score, BPH detection, and perineural growth detection are not mentioned in the provided text, so I've marked them as "NA" (not available).
