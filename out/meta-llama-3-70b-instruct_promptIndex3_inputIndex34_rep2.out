Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "150mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "yes"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is not explicitly stated, but based on the text, it seems that there are multiple samples (at least two, referred to as "sample 1B" and "other samples"). However, I've assumed it's 1 for simplicity.
* The size of the samples is given as a total length of approximately 150mm.
* There is no mention of the Gleason score, so it's marked as "NA".
* There is no mention of BPH or perineural growth, so they are marked as "NA".
* Atypia is mentioned in the description of sample 1B, so it's marked as "yes".
