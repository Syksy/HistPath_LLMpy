Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("12"),
  "2. Size of the samples taken": ("8mm", "7mm", "5mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("3+3=6"),
  "4. Is there benign prostatic hyperplasia?": ("ei"),
  "5. Is there perineural growth?": ("NA"),
  "6. Is there atypia?": ("ei")
}
```

Let me explain how I arrived at these answers:

1. The text states that carcinoma was found in 3/12 biopsies, so 12 samples were taken.
2. The sizes of the samples mentioned are 8mm, 7mm, and 5mm.
3. The Gleason score is reported as Gleason 3 architecture, which corresponds to a score of 3+3=6.
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the report, so I assume it's not present.
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so I marked it as NA (not available).
6. The report explicitly states that no nuclear atypia is observed, so I answered "ei" (no).
