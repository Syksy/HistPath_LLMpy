Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("12"),
  "2. Size of the samples taken": ("8mm", "7mm", "5mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("3+3=6"),
  "4. Is there benign prostatic hyperplasia?": ("ei"),
  "5. Is there perineural growth?": ("NA"),
  "6. Is there atypia?": ("ei")
}
```

Let me explain the answers:

1. The number of samples taken is 12, as mentioned in the text: "In summary, type 3+3 adenocarcinoma was found in 3/12 biopsies."
2. The sizes of the samples taken are 8mm, 7mm, and 5mm, as mentioned in the text: "an 8mm long biopsy and a 7mm long biopsy of the right base", "5 mm also with Gleason 3 architecture, carcinoma finding".
3. The Gleason score is 3+3=6, as mentioned in the text: "type 3+3 adenocarcinoma".
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth, so the answer is "NA" (not applicable).
6. The text explicitly states "No nuclear atypia is observed", so the answer is "ei" (no).
