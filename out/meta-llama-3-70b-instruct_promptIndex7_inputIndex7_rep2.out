Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "n. 120mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 6, because the report mentions "6 kpl edustavia prostatabiopsioita" (6 representative prostate biopsies).
* "sample_size_or_weight": "n. 120mm", because the report mentions "yhteens√§ n. 120mm" (total of approximately 120mm).
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA, because although the report mentions basaalisoluhyperplasiaa (basal cell hyperplasia), it does not explicitly state that it's only benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": NA, because the report does not mention atypia or any other abnormal changes in the tissue.
