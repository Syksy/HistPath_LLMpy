Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": NA, because the report does not mention the number of samples taken from the patient.
* "sample_size_or_weight": NA, because the report does not mention the size or weight of the samples.
* "Gleason_score": 7, because the report mentions "Gleason level 7 carcinoma".
* "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions "carcinoma", which is a malignant tumor, not a benign prostatic hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": NA, because the report does not mention atypia.
