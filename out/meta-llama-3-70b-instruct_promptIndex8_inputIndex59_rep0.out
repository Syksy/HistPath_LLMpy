Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30mm",
  "Gleason_score": "7 (3+4)",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "kyll√§"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at each value:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions "Three fusion biopsies", so I assume this refers to the number of samples taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions "total length of 30mm", which I assume refers to the size of the samples.
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions "score 7" and describes the architecture as "3 architecture approx. 2/3 and 4 architecture approx. 1/3 of the carcinoma part", which I interpret as a Gleason score of 7 with a breakdown of 3+4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions "carcinoma foci" and describes the growth as "level 3 grade growth", which suggests that the sample is not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I assume it is not present.
* `atypia`: The report mentions "Gleason type 4 spliced structure" which suggests that there are atypical changes present in the sample.
