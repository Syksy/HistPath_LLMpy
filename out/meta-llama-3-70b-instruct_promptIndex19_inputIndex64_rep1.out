I apologize, but the provided text is not a medical note written by a histopathologist in Finnish. It appears to be an error message related to a SQL query.

As a result, I cannot extract the requested information from the text. The answers would be:

{
"1. Number of samples": NA,
"2. Size of samples": NA,
"3. Gleason score": NA,
"4. BPH detection": NA,
"5. Perineural growth detection": NA,
"6. Atypia detection": NA
}

Please provide a valid medical note in Finnish, and I'll be happy to assist you in extracting the necessary information.
