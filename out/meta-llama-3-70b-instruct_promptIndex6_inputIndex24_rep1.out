Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "sample_count": 8,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 8 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the samples is not mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions that the finding is benign, indicating that only benign hyperplasia is present.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've marked it as false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I've marked it as false.

Please note that if any information is not available in the report, I will mark it as NA.
