Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_biopsies": 6,
  "biopsy_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": [
    {"score": 8, "primary": 4, "secondary": 4},
    {"score": 7, "primary": 4, "secondary": 3},
    {"score": 7, "primary": 3, "secondary": 4}
  ],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Note: 

* The number of biopsies is 6, as stated in the report.
* The biopsy size or weight is not mentioned in the report, so it is marked as NA.
* The Gleason scores are reported for three colonies, with their corresponding primary and secondary grades.
* The report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor, so "benign_hyperplasia_only" is set to false.
* There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so it is marked as NA.
* Atypia is mentioned in the report, specifically in the description of Colony 1, so it is marked as true.
