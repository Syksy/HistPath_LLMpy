Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_biopsies": 6,
  "biopsy_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": [
    {"score": 8, "primary_grade": 4, "secondary_grade": 4},
    {"score": 7, "primary_grade": 4, "secondary_grade": 3},
    {"score": 7, "primary_grade": 3, "secondary_grade": 4}
  ],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia_present": true
}
```

Note: I assumed that the presence of adenocarcinoma and atypical glandular structure indicates that the biopsy is not only benign hyperplasia. If this assumption is incorrect, please let me know.
