I'll go through the text and extract the requested information. Here is the response in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "NA",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "NA",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "NA"
}
```

The reason for all "NA" responses is that the provided text does not contain any information about the requested topics. The text appears to be a medical report describing a patient's symptoms and treatment, but it does not mention anything about histopathological samples or their characteristics.
