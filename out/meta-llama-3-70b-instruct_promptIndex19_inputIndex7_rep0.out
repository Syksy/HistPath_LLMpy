Explanation:

1. The text states "Näytteinä 6 kpl edustavia prostatabiopsioita", which means 6 representative prostate biopsy samples.
2. The text states "yhteensä n. 120mm", which means the total size of the samples is approximately 120mm.
3. There is no mention of Gleason score in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
4. The text states "Laseilla nähdään prostatakudoksessa paikoin basaalisoluhyperplasiaa", which means basal cell hyperplasia is seen in the prostate tissue, which is a characteristic of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia). So, the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
