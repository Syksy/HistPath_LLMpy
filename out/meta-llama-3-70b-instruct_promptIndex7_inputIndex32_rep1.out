Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "90mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 3, because the report mentions "3 prostatic core needle biopsies".
* "sample_size_or_weight": "90mm", because the report mentions "The total length of the samples is 90mm".
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention the Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": true, because the report suggests hyperplasia, but no malignancy.
* "perineural_invasion": false, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": false, because the report explicitly states "no atypia".
