Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has two biopsy samples, one from the right side and one from the left side.
2. The sizes of the biopsy samples are approximately 60mm from the right side and 80mm from the left side.
3. The Gleason score is 4+5=9, which indicates a high-grade cancer.
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or any other benign condition, so the answer is "ei" (no).
