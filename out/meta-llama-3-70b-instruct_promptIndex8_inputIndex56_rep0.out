Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150 mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": "kyllä",
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 12, because there are 12 representative needle biopsies.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "150 mm", because the total length of the samples is about 150 mm.
* "Gleason_score": NA, because there is no mention of Gleason score in the report.
* "benign_hyperplasia": "kyllä", because the report mentions "mostly benign growth".
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
