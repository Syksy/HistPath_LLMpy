I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text does not contain any relevant information about the histopathological sample. The text appears to be a jumbled collection of words and phrases, including a mathematical equation and some Finnish words.

As a result, I'm unable to provide answers to the questions based on the provided text. If you could provide a real histopathological report or a sample with relevant information, I'd be happy to assist you.

Here is the response in JSON format, with "NA" (Not Available) as the answer to each question:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "NA",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "NA",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "NA"
}
```

Please provide a real histopathological report, and I'll do my best to assist you.
