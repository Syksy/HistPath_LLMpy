Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12, // assuming 12 samples (D-G, K-P, O-Q)
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: 12 samples were taken from the patient, as indicated by the specimens labeled D-G, K-P, and O-Q.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: No information is provided about the size or weight of the samples, so NA is returned.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is 7, as stated in the report.
* `benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions a Gleason level 7 carcinoma, which indicates that the sample is not only benign prostatic hyperplasia, so this field is set to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so this field is set to false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so this field is set to false.
