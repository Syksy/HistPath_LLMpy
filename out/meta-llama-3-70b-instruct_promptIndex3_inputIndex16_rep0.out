Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+4=8, 3+4=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The text mentions "kuusi makroleikett√§" which means 6 macroscopic samples.
2. The size of the samples is not explicitly mentioned, so I've marked it as "NA".
3. The Gleason score is mentioned as 4+4 for the apex sample and 3+4 for the base sample.
4. There is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) in the text, so I've marked it as "NA".
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so I've marked it as "NA".
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so I've marked it as "NA".
