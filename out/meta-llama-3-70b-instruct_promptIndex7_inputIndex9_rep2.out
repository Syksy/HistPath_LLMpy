Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 8,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "13g",
  "Gleason_score": 6,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 8, because the report mentions that the samples were spread across 8 cassettes.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "13g", because the report mentions the total weight of the samples as 13g.
* "Gleason_score": 6, because the report explicitly mentions the Gleason score as 3+3=6.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only", "perineural_invasion", and "atypia" are all marked as NA, because the report does not provide any information about these specific aspects.
