Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 8,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "13g",
  "Gleason_score": 6,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions that the samples were spread across 8 cassettes, so I assume this is the number of samples.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions a total weight of 13g, so I assume this is the sample size or weight.
* `Gleason_score`: The report explicitly mentions a Gleason score of 3+3=6.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`, `perineural_invasion`, and `atypia`: These values are not mentioned in the report, so I return NA (Not Available) for each.
