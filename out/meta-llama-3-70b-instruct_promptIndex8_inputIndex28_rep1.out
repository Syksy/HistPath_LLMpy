Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": "4+3=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: 6, because there are 6 biopsy samples mentioned (1 basis oikea, 2 keski oikea, 3 apex oikea, 4 basis vasen, 5 keski vasen, 6 apex vasen).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, because no size or weight is mentioned for the samples.
* `Gleason_score`: "4+3=7", because the Gleason score is mentioned as 4+3=7.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei", because the report mentions Gleason scores, which indicate malignant growth.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: NA, because these are not mentioned in the report.
