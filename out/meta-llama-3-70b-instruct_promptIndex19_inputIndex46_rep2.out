* "ei" means "no" in Finnish.
* "kyll√§" means "yes" in Finnish, but it was not needed in this case.
* NA means "not available" or "not mentioned" in the text.
* The Gleason score is reported as major+minor=sum, and two different scores are mentioned in the text, one for the apex and one for the base.
