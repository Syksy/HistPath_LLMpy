Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "100mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* "sample_count": NA, because the report does not mention the number of samples taken from the patient.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "100mm", because the report mentions the total length of the sample as 100mm.
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention the Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions suspicion of malignancy and perineural growth, which suggests that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": true, because the report explicitly mentions perineural growth.
* "atypia": false, because the report does not mention atypia or any changes that would suggest atypia.
