Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["4mm", "6mm", "3mm", "5mm", "7mm", "8mm"],
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: 6 samples were taken from the patient (3 from the left and 3 from the right).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the samples are listed as an array.
* `Gleason_score`: Not mentioned in the report, so NA is returned.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: False, because the report mentions malignant growth and positive margins.
* `perineural_invasion`: Not mentioned in the report, so NA is returned.
* `atypia`: Not mentioned in the report, so NA is returned.
