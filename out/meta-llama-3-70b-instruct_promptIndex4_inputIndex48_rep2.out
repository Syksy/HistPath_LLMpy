Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4+6+3 mm (left), 5+7+8 mm (right)",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: 6 samples were taken from the patient (3 from the left and 3 from the right).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the samples are provided in millimeters.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (not available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions "malignant growth" and "adenocarcinoma suspicion", so it's clear that the samples are not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so it's marked as NA.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so it's marked as NA.
