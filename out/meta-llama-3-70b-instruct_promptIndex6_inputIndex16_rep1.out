Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "8mm and 5mm",
  "Gleason_score": "4+4 and 3+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case (6 macroblocks and normal microscopic sections).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size of the malignant foci, which are approximately 8mm and 5mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the samples, which are 4+4 and 3+4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia, which is false in this case since adenocarcinoma is present.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field indicates whether perineural invasion is present, but since it's not mentioned in the report, the value is NA (not available).
* `atypia`: This field indicates whether atypia is present, but since it's not mentioned in the report, the value is NA (not available).
