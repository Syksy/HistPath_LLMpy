Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "8mm and 5mm",
  "Gleason_score": "4+4 (apex) and 3+4 (base)",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient is 6, as mentioned in the report ("kuusi makroleikett√§").
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size of the malignant foci is approximately 8mm and 5mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported separately for the apex and base, as 4+4 and 3+4, respectively.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This is set to false, as the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These values are set to NA, as there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the report.
