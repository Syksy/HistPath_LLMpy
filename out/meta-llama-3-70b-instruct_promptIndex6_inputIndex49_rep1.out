Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "12.3g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: Since the report doesn't explicitly mention the number of samples, I assume it's one sample based on the context.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions the weight of the sample as 12.3g.
* `Gleason_score`: Since the report doesn't mention the Gleason score, I return NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report suggests that the specimen shows stromal hyperplasia, which is a benign condition, and there's no direct suggestion of malignancy.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report doesn't mention perineural invasion, so I return false.
* `atypia`: The report doesn't mention any atypical changes, so I return false.
