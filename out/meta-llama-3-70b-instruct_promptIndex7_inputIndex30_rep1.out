Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "100mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: The text mentions a single sample, so the answer is 1.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The text specifies the total length of the sample as 100mm.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the text, so the answer is NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The text mentions suspicious malignancy, so it's not just benign hyperplasia. The answer is false.
* `perineural_invasion`: The text explicitly states perineural growth, which is suspicious for malignancy. The answer is true.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the text, so the answer is false.
