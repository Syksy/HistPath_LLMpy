Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 9,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7/7/NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The text mentions several samples taken from different areas, including apex (A-C), base (D-E, F-G), and seminal vesicles (H-I). There are 9 samples in total.
2. The size of the samples is not explicitly mentioned in the text, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
3. The Gleason score is mentioned as 3 (major) and 4 (minor), with almost equal amounts of both. The sum is 7.
4. There is no mention of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the text, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so the answer is "ei" (no).
