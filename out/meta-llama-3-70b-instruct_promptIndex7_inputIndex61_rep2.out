I'll do my best to extract the relevant information from the given text and provide a structured response in JSON format.

Here's the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

The reason for all NA values is that the provided text does not contain any relevant information related to the asked questions. The text appears to be a nonsensical sequence of words and numbers, and it does not provide any meaningful information about the patient's samples or histopathological findings.
