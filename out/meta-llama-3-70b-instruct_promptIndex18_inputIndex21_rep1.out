Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "4g",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyll채",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is assumed to be 1, as the text mentions "N채yttein채" which means "sample" in Finnish, and it's not explicitly stated that there are multiple samples.
* The size of the samples is 4g, as mentioned in the text.
* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) detection is marked as "kyll채" (yes) because the text mentions "prostatahyperplasiaan" which suggests the presence of BPH.
* Perineural growth and atypia are not mentioned in the text, so they are marked as "ei" (no).
