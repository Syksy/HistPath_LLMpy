Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": "NA",
  "2. Size of samples": "5g",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+4=8",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 1, the number of samples is not explicitly mentioned, so I've marked it as "NA" (not available).
* For question 4, there is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) in the text, so I've marked it as "ei" (no).
* For questions 5 and 6, there is no mention of perineural growth or atypia in the text, so I've marked them as "NA" (not available).
