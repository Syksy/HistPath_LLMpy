Here are the answers to the questions based on the provided histopathological report:

{
"(Näytteiden määrä)": NA,
"(Näytteiden koko)": 150,
"(Gleason-luokitus)": NA,
"(Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu)": ei,
"(Perineuraalinen kasvu)": NA,
"(Atypia)": kyllä
}

Note: 

* For question 1, the report does not explicitly state the number of samples taken, so the answer is NA.
* For question 2, the report mentions that the total length of the samples is approximately 150mm, but it does not specify the size of individual samples. Therefore, the answer is 150, but it's not clear if this is the size of each sample or the total length of all samples.
* For question 3, the report does not mention the Gleason score, so the answer is NA.
* For question 4, the report does not mention any benign prostatic hyperplasia, so the answer is ei (no).
* For question 5, the report does not mention perineural growth, so the answer is NA.
* For question 6, the report mentions nuclear atypia, so the answer is kyllä (yes).
