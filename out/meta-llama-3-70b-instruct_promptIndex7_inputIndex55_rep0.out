  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 4,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 4, because the report mentions "Samples 1-4".
* "sample_size_or_weight": NA, because the report does not provide information about the size or weight of the samples.
