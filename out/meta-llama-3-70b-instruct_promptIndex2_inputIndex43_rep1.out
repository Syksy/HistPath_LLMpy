Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("19g of prostate shavings"),
  "2. Size of the samples taken": ("10g were put into histology"),
  "3. Gleason classification": ("5+4=9"),
  "4. Is there benign prostatic hyperplasia?": ("ei"),
  "5. Is there perineural growth?": ("NA"),
  "6. Is there atypia?": ("kyllä")
}
```

Note: 

* For question 1, I assumed that the total amount of prostate shavings (19g) represents the number of samples taken.
* For question 4, I answered "ei" (no) because the text does not mention benign prostatic hyperplasia.
* For question 5, I answered "NA" (not available) because the text does not mention perineural growth.
* For question 6, I answered "kyllä" (yes) because the text describes a malignant growth with enlarged nuclei and varying sizes, which suggests atypia.
