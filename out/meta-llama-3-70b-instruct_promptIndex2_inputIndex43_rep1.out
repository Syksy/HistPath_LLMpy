Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("19g of prostate shavings"),
  "2. Size of the samples taken": ("19g"),
  "3. Gleason classification": ("5+4=9"),
  "4. Is there benign prostatic hyperplasia in the sample?": ("ei"),
  "5. Is there perineural growth in the sample?": ("NA"),
  "6. Is there atypia in the sample?": ("NA")
}
```

Note: 

* For question 1, the answer is not a direct number, but rather a description of the total amount of prostate shavings taken.
* For question 4, the answer is "ei" (no) because the text does not mention benign prostatic hyperplasia.
* For questions 5 and 6, the answer is "NA" (not available) because the text does not mention perineural growth or atypia.
