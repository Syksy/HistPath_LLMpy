Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": "NA",
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "no",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 1, the number of samples is not explicitly mentioned, so I've marked it as "NA".
* For question 2, the size of the samples is not mentioned, so I've marked it as "NA".
* For question 4, there is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) in the text, so I've marked it as "NA".
* For question 5, the text mentions "Läpikasvua ei nähdä" which means "No perineural growth is seen", so I've marked it as "no".
* For question 6, there is no mention of atypia in the text, so I've marked it as "NA".
