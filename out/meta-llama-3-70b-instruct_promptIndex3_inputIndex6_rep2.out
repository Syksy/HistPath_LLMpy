Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": "NA",
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "no",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples and size of samples cannot be determined from the given text, so I've marked them as 'NA' (Not Available).
* The Gleason score is mentioned as 7, with a major component of 3 and a minor component of 4.
* There is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) or atypia in the text, so I've marked them as 'NA'.
* Perineural growth is not detected, as mentioned in the text ("Läpikasvua ei nähdä").
