Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "5g",
  "Gleason_score": 8,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions that multiple samples were taken from the patient, but it doesn't specify an exact number. However, since all samples were examined and showed similar findings, I assume there was only one sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report states that the total weight of the samples was approximately 5g.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as 8, with a primary pattern of 4 and various variants.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report explicitly mentions adenocarcinoma, which indicates that the finding is not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These features are not mentioned in the report, so I return NA (Not Available) for these fields.
