Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 14,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+3=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "yes",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 14 because there are 4 samples labeled A-D, 2 samples labeled E-F, 7 samples labeled G-N, and 1 sample labeled N-O.
* The size of the samples is not specified in the text, so it's marked as "NA".
* The Gleason score is reported as having a major component of 4 and a minor component of 3, so the sum is 7.
* There is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) or atypia in the text, so they are marked as "NA".
* Perineural growth is mentioned as being detected ("havaitaan runsaasti").
