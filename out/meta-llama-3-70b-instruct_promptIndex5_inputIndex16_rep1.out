Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "Not applicable (prostatectomy resection)",
  "Gleason_score": {
    "apex": "4+4",
    "base": "3+4"
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case (6 macroblocks).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Since this is a prostatectomy resection, there is no specific size or weight for each sample, so we return "Not applicable".
* `Gleason_score`: We have two Gleason scores, one for the apex and one for the base, which are "4+4" and "3+4", respectively.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This is false, since the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor.
* `perineural_invasion`: This is false, since the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: This is false, since the report does not mention atypia.
