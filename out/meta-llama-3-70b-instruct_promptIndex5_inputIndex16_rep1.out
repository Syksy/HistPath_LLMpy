Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": {
    "apex": "4+4",
    "base": "3+4"
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case (6 macroblocks).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: A dictionary with two keys, `apex` and `base`, representing the Gleason scores for the apex and base regions, respectively.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: False, because the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor.
* `perineural_invasion`: False, because there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: False, because there is no mention of atypia in the report.
