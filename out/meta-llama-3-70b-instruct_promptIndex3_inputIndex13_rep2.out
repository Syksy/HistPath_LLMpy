Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "19g (10g sent for histology)",
  "3. Gleason score": "5+4",
  "4. BPH detection": "yes",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is assumed to be 1 since the text does not mention multiple samples.
* The size of the samples is given as 19g, with 10g sent for histology.
* The Gleason score is reported as having mostly grade 5 and secondly grade 4, so it's represented as 5+4.
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) can be inferred from the presence of fibromuscular stroma, so it's marked as 'yes'.
* There is no mention of perineural growth or atypia in the text, so they are marked as 'NA' (not available).
