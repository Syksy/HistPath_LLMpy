Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 2,
  "sample_size_or_weight": {
    "right": "60mm",
    "left": "80mm"
  },
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary": 4,
    "secondary": 5,
    "total": 9
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is not explicitly stated in the report but can be inferred to be at least 2 (one from the right and one from the left).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of each sample, which is reported as approximately 60mm for the right sample and approximately 80mm for the left sample.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the cancerous tissue, which is reported as a primary score of 4, a secondary score of 5, and a total score of 9 (4+5).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer), which is false in this case since cancer was detected.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are marked as NA (not available) since there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the report.
