Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "num_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["5mm", "10mm", null, null, null, null],
  "Gleason_score": [8, 7, 7, null, null, null],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": null,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `num_samples`: The number of biopsy samples taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: An array of sample sizes or weights. In this case, only two samples have reported sizes (5mm and 10mm), so the rest are null.
* `Gleason_score`: An array of Gleason scores for each sample. Only three samples have reported Gleason scores (8, 7, and 7), so the rest are null.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample shows only benign hyperplasia. In this case, it's false because some samples show adenocarcinoma.
* `perineural_invasion`: A boolean indicating whether perineural invasion is present. Since it's not mentioned in the report, it's null.
* `atypia`: A boolean indicating whether atypia is present. In this case, it's true because one sample shows atypia.
