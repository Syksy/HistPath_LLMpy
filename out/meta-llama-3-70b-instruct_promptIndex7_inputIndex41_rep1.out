Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 13,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "about 180mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples" is 13, as stated in the report.
* "sample_size_or_weight" is "about 180mm", which is the length of the material examined.
* "Gleason_score" is NA, as it is not explicitly mentioned in the report.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only" is false, as carcinoma was found in some biopsies.
* "perineural_invasion" and "atypia" are both NA, as there is no mention of these features in the report.
