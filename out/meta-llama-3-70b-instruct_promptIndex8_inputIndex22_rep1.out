Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": "multiple",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": "3+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: Multiple samples were taken, but the exact number is not specified.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: No information about the size or weight of the samples is provided.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as 3+4, which means the primary pattern is 3 and the secondary pattern is 4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report indicates that there is a large tumor, so it's not just benign hyperplasia (ei = no).
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report (ei = no).
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report (ei = no).
