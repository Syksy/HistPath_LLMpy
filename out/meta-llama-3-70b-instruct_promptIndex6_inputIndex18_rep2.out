Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["4+6+3 mm", "5+7+8 mm"],
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of samples taken from the patient is 6 (4+6+3 from the left and 5+7+8 from the right).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the samples are provided as a list of strings, since there are multiple samples with different sizes.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so it is marked as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions malignant growth and positive margins, indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia, so this field is set to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so it is marked as NA.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so it is marked as NA.
