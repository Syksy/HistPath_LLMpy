Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": "4+3=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 6, because there are 6 biopsy samples mentioned in the report.
* "sample_size_or_weight": NA, because the report does not provide information about the size or weight of the samples.
* "Gleason_score": "4+3=7", because the report mentions Gleason 4+3=7 growth patterns in samples 5-6.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions Gleason 5 and 4+3=7 growth patterns, which are not benign.
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because the report does not provide information about perineural invasion.
* "atypia": NA, because the report does not provide information about atypia.
