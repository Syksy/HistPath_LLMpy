Based on the provided free-text histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_size": "150 mm",
  "gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of needle biopsies taken from the patient, which is 12 in this case.
* `sample_size`: The total length of the samples, which is approximately 150 mm.
* `gleason_score`: Since the Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, it is marked as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia`: This field is set to true, indicating that the report mentions "mostly benign growth" and "hyperplastic-like epithelium".
* `perineural_invasion`: This field is set to false, as there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: This field is set to false, as there is no mention of atypia or any abnormal changes in the report.
