Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"sample": 1, "size_or_weight": "10mm"},
    {"sample": 2, "size_or_weight": "8mm"},
    {"sample": 3, "size_or_weight": "14mm"},
    {"sample": 4, "size_or_weight": "14mm"}
  ],
  "gleason_score": {"sample": 4, "score": "3+4"},
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: An array of objects, each containing the sample number and its corresponding size or weight.
* `gleason_score`: An object containing the sample number and its corresponding Gleason score.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (false in this case, since adenocarcinoma is present).
* `perineural_invasion`: A boolean indicating whether perineural invasion is present (false in this case).
* `atypia`: Since there is no mention of atypia in the original report, the value is set to NA (not available).
