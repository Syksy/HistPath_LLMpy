Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "6",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": [
    {"Pesäke 1": "4+4=8"},
    {"Pesäke 2": "4+3=7"},
    {"Pesäke 3": "3+4=7"}
  ],
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "kyllä"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 2, the size of the biopsies is not explicitly mentioned, so I answered "NA" (not available).
* For question 3, I listed the Gleason scores for each biopsy separately, as they are different.
* For question 4, I answered "ei" (no) because the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a type of cancer, not a benign hyperplasia.
* For question 5, I answered "NA" because there is no mention of perineural growth in the report.
* For question 6, I answered "kyllä" (yes) because the report mentions "huonosti erilaistunutta atyyppista rauhasrakennetta" which translates to "poorly differentiated atypical glandular structure", indicating atypia.
