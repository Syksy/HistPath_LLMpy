Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": ["5mm", "10mm", "NA", "NA", "NA", "NA"],
  "3. Gleason score": ["4+4=8", "4+3=7", "3+4=7", "NA", "NA", "NA"],
  "4. BPH detection": "no",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "yes"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 2, only two sample sizes are mentioned in the text, so the rest are marked as "NA" (not available).
* For question 3, only three Gleason scores are mentioned in the text, so the rest are marked as "NA" (not available).
* For question 4, BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not explicitly mentioned in the text, but hyperplastic changes are mentioned, which are not the same as BPH. Therefore, the answer is "no".
* For question 5, perineural growth is not mentioned in the text at all, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
* For question 6, atypia is mentioned in the text, so the answer is "yes".
