I apologize, but the provided text "Beep boop? Boop biip. Blarp!" does not contain any relevant information about a histopathological report of a prostate cancer sample. It appears to be a nonsensical sequence of words.

As a result, I cannot provide answers to the questions in the format you requested. If you could provide the actual histopathological report, I would be happy to help you extract the relevant information.

Here is an example of what the output could look like in JSON format:

```
{
  "näytteiden määrä": NA,
  "näytteiden koko": NA,
  "Gleason-luokitus": NA,
  "hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": NA,
  "perineuraalinen kasvu": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Please provide the actual report, and I'll do my best to assist you.
