Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 12,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyllä",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 2, the size of the samples is not mentioned in the text, so I answered "NA" (Not Available).
* For question 4, I assumed that "rauhasrakennetta" refers to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), so I answered "kyllä" (yes).
* For questions 5 and 6, I couldn't find any mention of perineural growth or atypia in the text, so I answered "ei" (no).
