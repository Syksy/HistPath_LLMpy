Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 8, 
  "sample_size_or_weight": "13g", 
  "Gleason_score": "3+3=6", 
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei", 
  "perineural_invasion": "NA", 
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Let me explain how I arrived at this result:

* `sample_count`: The text mentions that the samples were spread across 8 cassettes, so I assume this is the number of samples.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The text mentions a total weight of 13g, so I use this value.
* `Gleason_score`: The text explicitly states the Gleason score as 3+3=6.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since the text mentions carcinoma (karsinoomaa), I assume this is not a case of benign hyperplasia only, so I set this to "ei" (no).
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These are not mentioned in the original text, so I set them to "NA" (not available).
