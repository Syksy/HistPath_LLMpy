Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "approx. 150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": "yes"
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 1, because the report mentions "sample 1B" and does not indicate multiple samples.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "approx. 150mm", because the report mentions the total length of the sample.
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention the Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA, because the report does not explicitly state that the sample only shows benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": "yes", because the report mentions "nuclear atypia" in sample 1B.
