Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"side": "left", "size": "10mm"},
    {"side": "left", "size": "7mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "15mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "10mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": {"left": "3+4"},
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 4 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: An array of objects describing the size of each sample. Since the sizes are given in millimeters, I assumed they are lengths.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score for the left side, which is 3+4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia. In this case, it's false because the sample shows malignant features.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field indicates whether perineural invasion is present. In this case, it's true because the report mentions "hermojen ja suonien ympärillä kasvustoa" which translates to "growth around nerves and vessels".
* `atypia`: This field indicates whether atypia is present. Since the report doesn't mention atypia, I returned NA (Not Available).
