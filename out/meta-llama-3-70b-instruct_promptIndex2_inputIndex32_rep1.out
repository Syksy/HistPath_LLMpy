Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("3"),
  "2. Size of samples": ("90mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("NA"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("kyllä"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("NA"),
  "6. Atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Let me explain my answers:

1. The report states that there are "3 prostatic core needle biopsies", so the answer is 3.
2. The total length of the samples is 90mm, as stated in the report.
3. There is no mention of a Gleason score in the report, so the answer is NA (not available).
4. The report mentions "glandular structures, which would perhaps indicate hyperplasia", suggesting that benign prostatic hyperplasia is present, so the answer is kyllä (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is NA (not available).
6. The report explicitly states that "no atypia or findings suggestive of malignancy" were found, so the answer is ei (no).
