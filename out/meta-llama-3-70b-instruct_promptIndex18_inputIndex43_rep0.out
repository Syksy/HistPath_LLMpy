Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": "1",
  "2. Size of samples": "19g",
  "3. Gleason score": "5+4=9/9",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "kyllä"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 1, I assumed that the "prostate shavings" refer to a single sample, as there is no indication of multiple samples.
* For question 4, I answered "ei" (no) because BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not mentioned in the text.
* For question 5, I answered "NA" (not available) because perineural growth is not mentioned in the text.
* For question 6, I answered "kyllä" (yes) because the text mentions "a carpet-like malignant growth" and "enlarged" and "varying" nuclei, which are indicative of atypia.
