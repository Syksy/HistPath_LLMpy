Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",

}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples is 6 (3 from the left and 3 from the right).
2. The size of the samples is 4+6+3 mm from the left and 5+7+8 mm from the right.
3. There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so the answer is "NA".
4. The report mentions "malignant growth" and "strong adenocarcinoma suspicion", but does not mention "hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu" (benign prostatic hyperplasia), so the answer is "ei".
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is "NA".
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "NA".
