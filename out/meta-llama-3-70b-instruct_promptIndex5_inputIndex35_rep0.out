Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "5g",
  "Gleason_score": 8,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": null,
  "atypia": null
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: Since it's a TURP sample, I assume it's a single sample. If it were a biopsy, I would count the number of cores.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The weight of the prostate shavings is 5g.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is 8, which is a combination of the primary and secondary patterns (in this case, Gleason 4 and its variants).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This is set to `false` because the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These are set to `null` because there is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the report.
