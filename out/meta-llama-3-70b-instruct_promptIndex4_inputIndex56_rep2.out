Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150 mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 12, because the report mentions "12 representative needle biopsies".
* "sample_size_or_weight": "150 mm", because the report mentions "The total length of the samples is about 150 mm".
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention the Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": true, because the report mentions "So the end result is mostly benign growth".
* "perineural_invasion": false, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": false, because the report does not mention atypia.
