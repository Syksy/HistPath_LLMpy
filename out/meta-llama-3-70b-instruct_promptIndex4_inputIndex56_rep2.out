Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150 mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples" is 12, as there are 12 representative needle biopsies.
* "sample_size_or_weight" is "150 mm", which is the total length of the samples.
* "Gleason_score" is NA, as there is no mention of Gleason score in the report.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only" is true, as the report states that the end result is mostly benign growth.
* "perineural_invasion" is false, as there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
