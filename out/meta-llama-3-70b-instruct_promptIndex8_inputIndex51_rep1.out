Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": "kyllä",
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: NA, because the text does not explicitly mention the number of samples taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: "4g", because the text mentions that a total of 4g of planing chips were taken.
* `Gleason_score`: NA, because the text does not mention the Gleason score.
* `benign_hyperplasia`: "kyllä", because the text suggests subtly prostatic hyperplasia, which is a benign condition.
* `perineural_invasion`: NA, because the text does not mention perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: NA, because the text does not mention atypia.
