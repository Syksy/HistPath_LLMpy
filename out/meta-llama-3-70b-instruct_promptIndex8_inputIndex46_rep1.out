Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "8mm, 5mm",
  "Gleason_score": "4+4, 3+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: 6, because the report mentions "six macrosections" were made.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: "8mm, 5mm", because the report mentions the sizes of the foci of the malignant samples.
* `Gleason_score`: "4+4, 3+4", because the report mentions the Gleason scores in different sections of the prostate.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei", because the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor.
* `perineural_invasion`: "ei", because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: "ei", because the report does not mention atypia.
