Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of biopsy samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the samples is not mentioned in the report, so I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is reported as 4+3=7, which indicates a moderately differentiated tumor.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions Gleason 5 growth patterns and poorly differentiated Gleason 4+3=7 growth, indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia, so I've marked it as false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `atypia`: The report does not mention any atypia or abnormal changes in the tissue, so I've marked it as false.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with!
