Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "120mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: 6, as there are 6 representative prostate biopsies.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: "120mm", as the total size of the samples is approximately 120mm.
* `Gleason_score`: NA, as there is no mention of a Gleason score in the report.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei", as the report mentions basal cell hyperplasia, but also notes that a definite cancer diagnosis cannot be given, indicating that it's not only benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: NA, as there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: NA, as there is no mention of atypia in the report.
