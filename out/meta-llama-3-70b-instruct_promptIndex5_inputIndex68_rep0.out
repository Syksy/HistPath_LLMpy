I apologize, but the provided text does not appear to be a histopathological report. It seems to be a passage from a physics textbook, discussing the concept of work and kinetic energy.

If you could provide an actual histopathological report, I would be happy to help you convert it into a structured format in JSON. Please provide the report, and I'll do my best to extract the relevant information and provide it in the desired format.
