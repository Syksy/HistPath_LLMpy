Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "90mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "kyllä",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Note: I assumed that the presence of hyperplasia and the absence of atypia or malignant findings indicate that the sample is benign, hence `benign_hyperplasia_only` is set to `"kyllä"`. If this assumption is incorrect, please let me know.
