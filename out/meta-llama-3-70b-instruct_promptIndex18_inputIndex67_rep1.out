I'm happy to help! However, I must point out that the provided text is not a medical note written by a pathologist, but rather a general information text about prostate cancer. It does not contain specific information about a patient's samples or diagnosis.

Therefore, I will provide answers based on the lack of information in the text. Here is the response in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": "NA",
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Please provide a real medical note written by a pathologist, and I'll be happy to help you extract the necessary information.
