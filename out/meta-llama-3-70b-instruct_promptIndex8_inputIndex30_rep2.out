Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "100mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "kyllä",
  "atypia_present": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: Not mentioned in the report, so NA.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions a total length of 100mm, so this value is used.
* `Gleason_score`: Not mentioned in the report, so NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions suspicious malignancy, so it's not only benign hyperplasia, hence "ei".
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly mentions perineural growth, so "kyllä".
* `atypia_present`: Not explicitly mentioned in the report, so NA.
