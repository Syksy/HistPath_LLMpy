Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": "1", 
  "sample_size": "100mm", 
  "gleason_score": "NA", 
  "benign_hyperplasia": "NA", 
  "perineural_invasion": "kyllä", 
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Since the report mentions a single "representative sample", I assume it's a single sample.
* `sample_size`: The report mentions a total length of 100mm, so I use that as the sample size.
* `gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I return NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia`: There is no clear indication of benign hyperplasia in the report, so I return NA.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report mentions "perineural growth" which is suspicious for malignancy, so I return "kyllä".
* `atypia`: The report does not mention any atypia, so I return "ei".
