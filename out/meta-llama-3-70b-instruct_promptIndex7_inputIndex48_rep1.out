Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4+6+3 mm (left), 5+7+8 mm (right)",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 6, because there are 6 samples mentioned in the report (3 from the left and 3 from the right).
* "sample_size_or_weight": The sizes of the samples are provided, but it's not clear if they refer to length or weight, so I kept the original units.
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention the Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA, because the report mentions "malignant growth" and "adenocarcinoma suspicion", which suggests that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": NA, because the report does not mention atypia.
