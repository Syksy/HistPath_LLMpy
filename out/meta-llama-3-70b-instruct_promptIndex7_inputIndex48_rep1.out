Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4+6+3mm (left), 5+7+8mm (right)",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: 6, because there are 6 samples mentioned in the report (3 from the left and 3 from the right).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the samples are provided, but it's a bit unclear due to the indexing issue. I've tried to summarize the sizes as accurately as possible.
* `Gleason_score`: NA, because the Gleason score is not explicitly mentioned in the report.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: NA, because the report mentions malignant growth and positive margins, which suggests that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: NA, because there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: NA, because there is no mention of atypia in the report.

Note that I've followed the instructions to return NA for any values that are not explicitly mentioned or are uncertain.
