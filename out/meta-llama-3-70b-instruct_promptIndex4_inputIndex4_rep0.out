Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions "Kaseteissa" which implies multiple samples, but it's not clear how many. However, the report only describes one sample (1B) in detail, so I assumed there's only one sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions "kokonaispituus n. 150mm", which suggests the sample size is approximately 150mm.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I returned NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions "hyppää esiin fokus" which suggests that there's a focus of abnormal cells, and "tuma-atypiaa" which implies atypia. Therefore, I returned false, indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I returned NA.
* `atypia`: The report mentions "tuma-atypiaa", which implies atypia, so I returned true.
