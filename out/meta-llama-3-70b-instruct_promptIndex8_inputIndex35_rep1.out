Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": "NA",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "5g",
  "Gleason_score": "4+4=8",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Since the report doesn't explicitly mention the number of samples, I've marked it as "NA".
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions "about 5g of prostate shavings", so I've filled in this field with "5g".
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions "Gleason 4 and its various variants, so the total score is 8", which I've interpreted as a Gleason score of "4+4=8".
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since the report mentions "adenocarcinoma" (a type of cancer), I've marked this field as "ei" (no).
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields are not mentioned in the report, so I've marked them as "NA".
