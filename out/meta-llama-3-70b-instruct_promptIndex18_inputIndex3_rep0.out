Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 2,
  "2. Size of samples": "60mm (right), 80mm (left)",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+5=9",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "kyll√§"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 4, since the text doesn't mention BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia), I assumed it's not detected.
* For question 5, since the text doesn't mention perineural growth, I marked it as NA (Not Available).
* For question 6, since the text mentions "karsinoomaa" (carcinoma) and "muutosta" (change), I assumed atypia is detected.
