I'll do my best to extract the relevant information from the given text and return it in a structured JSON format.

Here's the result:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

The reason for all the `NA` values is that the given text does not contain any relevant information about the histopathological sample. The text appears to be a test sentence designed to confuse the language model, and it does not provide any actual data about the sample.
