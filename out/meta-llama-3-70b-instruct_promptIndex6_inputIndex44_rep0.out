Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"sample": 1, "size": 10, "unit": "mm"},
    {"sample": 2, "size": 8, "unit": "mm"},
    {"sample": 3, "size": 14, "unit": "mm"},
    {"sample": 4, "size": 14, "unit": "mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": {"sample": 4, "score": 3, "percentage": 90, "pattern": "glandular structures"},
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Note: I assumed that "atypia" is not mentioned in the original report, so I returned NA (Not Available) for that field. If you want to change this assumption, please let me know!
