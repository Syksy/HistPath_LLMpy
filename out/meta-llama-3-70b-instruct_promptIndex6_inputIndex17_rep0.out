Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"side": "left", "size": "10mm"},
    {"side": "left", "size": "7mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "15mm"},
    {"side": "right", "size": "10mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary_pattern": 3,
    "secondary_pattern": 4
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia_present": NA
}
```

Note: I assumed that the Gleason score is reported as a primary and secondary pattern, but if it's meant to be a single score, please let me know and I'll adjust accordingly. Also, since there was no mention of atypia in the original report, I returned NA for that field.
