Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "90mm",
  "gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "kyllä",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: 3, as there are 3 prostatic core needle biopsies.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: "90mm", as the total length of the samples is 90mm.
* `gleason_score`: NA, as there is no mention of Gleason score in the report.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "kyllä", as the report suggests hyperplasia, but no malignancy.
* `perineural_invasion`: "ei", as there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: "ei", as the report explicitly states that no atypia was found.
