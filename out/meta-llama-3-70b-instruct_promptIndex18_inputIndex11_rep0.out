Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 13,
  "2. Size of samples": "noin 180mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7/7/NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 4, I assumed BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is "ei" (no).
* For questions 5 and 6, I couldn't find any information about perineural growth or atypia in the text, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
