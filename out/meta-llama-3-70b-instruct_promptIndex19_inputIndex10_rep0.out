Here are the answers to the questions based on the provided medical note:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 14,
  "2. Size of samples": "macrosections",
  "3. Gleason score": "4+3=7/7/NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "yes",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 14, as there are 4 samples labeled A-D, 2 samples labeled E-F, 7 samples labeled G-N, and 1 sample labeled N-O.
* The size of the samples is described as macrosections, which means they are large sections of tissue.
* The Gleason score is reported as 4+3=7, indicating that the predominant pattern is grade 4 and the secondary pattern is grade 3.
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not mentioned in the report, so it is assumed to be absent.
* Perineural growth is explicitly mentioned in the report, so it is present.
* Atypia is not mentioned in the report, so it is assumed to be absent.
