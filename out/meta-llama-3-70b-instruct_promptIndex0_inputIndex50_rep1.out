Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "a. Näytteiden määrä": 6,
  "b. Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "c. Gleason-luokitus": [8, 7, 7],
  "d. Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "e. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "f. Atypia": "kyllä"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

a. The number of biopsy specimens taken is 6.

b. The size of the biopsy specimens is not explicitly mentioned in the report, so the answer is "NA".

c. The Gleason scores mentioned in the report are 8, 7, and 7, corresponding to the three colonies with carcinoma tissue.

d. The report does not mention benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or any other type of benign growth, so the answer is "ei" (no).

e. The report does not mention perineural invasion, so the answer is "NA".

f. The report mentions "atypical glandular structure" in Colony 1, which implies atypia, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
