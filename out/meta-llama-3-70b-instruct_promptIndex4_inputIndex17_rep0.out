Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["10mm", "7mm", "15mm", "10mm"],
  "Gleason_score": 3,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 4 in this case (2 from the left side and 2 from the right side).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: An array of sample sizes or weights, which are 10mm, 7mm, 15mm, and 10mm respectively.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the sample, which is 3 in this case.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia. In this case, it's false because the sample also shows malignant features.
* `perineural_invasion`: A boolean indicating whether perineural invasion is present. In this case, it's true because the report mentions "kasvustoa hermojen ja suonien ympärillä" (growth around nerves and vessels).
* `atypia`: A boolean indicating whether atypia is present. In this case, it's true because the report mentions "matalalle erilaistunutta karsinoomasolukkoa" (low-grade differentiated carcinoma cells), which implies atypical changes.
