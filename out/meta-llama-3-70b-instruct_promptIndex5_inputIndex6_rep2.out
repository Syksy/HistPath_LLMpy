Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: Since the report mentions a single prostatectomy specimen, I assume there is only one sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report does not provide information on the size or weight of the sample, so I marked it as "NA" (not available).
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions a Gleason score of 7, which is a measure of the aggressiveness of the cancer.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions a tumor, which indicates that it's not just benign hyperplasia, so I set this field to `false`.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report does not mention perineural invasion, so I set this field to `false`.
* `atypia`: The report does not mention atypia, so I set this field to `false`.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to clarify any of these fields!
