  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "(kyllä)",

Note: 

* The number of samples is 8, as mentioned in the text ("kahdeksassa blokissa").
* The size of the samples is not mentioned, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
* There is no mention of Gleason score, so it's marked as NA.
* The text states that the finding is benign, which means there is no malignant growth, so the answer to question 4 is "kyllä" (yes).
* There is no mention of perineural growth or atypia, so the answers to questions 5 and 6 are both "ei" (no).
