Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": "3+4=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: 6, as there are six formalin-fixed preparations.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, as there is no information about the size or weight of the samples.
* `Gleason_score`: "3+4=7", as the Gleason score is reported as 3+4=7.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei", as the report mentions glandular fusion and Gleason class 3 and 4, indicating that it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: "ei", as the report explicitly states that there is no perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: NA, as there is no mention of atypia in the report.
