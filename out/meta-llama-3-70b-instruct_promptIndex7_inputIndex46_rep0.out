Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "8mm and 5mm",
  "Gleason_score": "4+4 and 3+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Note: I've assumed that the number of samples refers to the six macrosections mentioned in the report. If this is not the case, please let me know.

Also, I've returned NA for perineural invasion and atypia since these features are not explicitly mentioned in the report.
