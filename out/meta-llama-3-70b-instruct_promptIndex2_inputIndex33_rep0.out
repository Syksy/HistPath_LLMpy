Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("2"),
  "2. Size of samples": ("60mm on the right, 80mm on the left"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("4+5=9"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("NA"),
  "6. Atypia": ("NA")
}
```

Note: 

* For question 4, I assumed that "hyv√§laatuista eturauhasen liikakasvua" refers to benign prostatic hyperplasia, and since the report mentions carcinoma, I answered "ei".
* For questions 5 and 6, I answered "NA" because there is no mention of perineural growth or atypia in the report.
