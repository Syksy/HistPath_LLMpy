Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": [
    "4+4=8",
    "4+3=7",
    "3+4=7"
  ],
  "4. BPH detection": "yes",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "yes"
}
```

Note: 

* The size of the samples is not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I've marked it as "NA" (not available).
* The Gleason score is reported for three different colonies, so I've listed all three scores.
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is detected in the samples, as "hyperplastic changes in the epithelium" are mentioned.
* There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so I've marked it as "NA".
* Atypia is detected in the samples, as "atypical glandular structure" is mentioned in the text.
