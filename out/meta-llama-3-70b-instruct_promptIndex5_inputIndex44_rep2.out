Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "num_samples": 4,
  "sample_info": [
    {"sample_id": 1, "size_mm": 10, "representative": false},
    {"sample_id": 2, "size_mm": 8, "representative": true},
    {"sample_id": 3, "size_mm": 14, "representative": true},
    {"sample_id": 4, "size_mm": 14, "representative": true}
  ],
  "gleason_score": {
    "primary_pattern": 3,
    "secondary_pattern": 4,
    "percentage_primary_pattern": 90,
    "percentage_secondary_pattern": 10
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia_present": false
}
```

Let me explain how I arrived at this structured report:

* `num_samples`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 4 in this case.
* `sample_info`: An array of objects, each representing a sample. The properties are:
	+ `sample_id`: A unique identifier for each sample (1-4).
	+ `size_mm`: The size of each sample in millimeters.
	+ `representative`: A boolean indicating whether the sample is representative of healthy prostate tissue or not.
* `gleason_score`: An object containing the Gleason score information:
	+ `primary_pattern` and `secondary_pattern`: The primary and secondary patterns of the Gleason score (3 and 4, respectively).
	+ `percentage_primary_pattern` and `percentage_secondary_pattern`: The percentages of each pattern (90% and 10%, respectively).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample shows only benign hyperplasia (false in this case, since adenocarcinoma is present).
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia_present`: Booleans indicating whether perineural invasion or atypia are present in the sample (both false in this case).
