Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": {
    "sample_1": "10mm",
    "sample_2": "8mm",
    "sample_3": "14mm",
    "sample_4": "14mm"
  },
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary_pattern": 3,
    "secondary_pattern": 4,
    "percentage_primary_pattern": 90,
    "percentage_secondary_pattern": 10
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Note: Since there is no mention of atypia in the original report, I have returned NA (Not Available) for that field.
