Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "2mm",
  "Gleason_score": "4+3",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 4 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size of the sample, which is 2mm in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score, which is 4+3 in this case, indicating a dominant Gleason score of 4 and a secondary score of 3.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia, which is "ei" (no) in this case, since the sample shows adenocarcinoma.
* `perineural_invasion`: Whether perineural invasion is present, which is "NA" (not available) in this case, since it's not mentioned in the report.
* `atypia`: Whether atypia is present, which is "NA" (not available) in this case, since it's not mentioned in the report.
