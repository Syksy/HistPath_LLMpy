Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 12,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text states that 12 tissue blocks were cut from the shavings obtained from planing, so the number of samples is 12.
2. The size of the samples is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
3. The Gleason sum is 7, with the larger portion being class 3, which corresponds to a Gleason score of 3+4=7.
4. There is no mention of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the text, so it is unlikely to be detected in the samples, and the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
