Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 13,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "about 180mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 13, because the report states "A total of 13 biopsies".
* "sample_size_or_weight": "about 180mm", because the report mentions "about 180mm of material".
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not provide a clear Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA, because the report mentions carcinoma, which indicates that it's not a case of benign hyperplasia only.
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": NA, because the report does not mention atypia.
