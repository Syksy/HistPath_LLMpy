Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "2mm (sample 2)",
  "Gleason_score": 4,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 4 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample, which is 2mm for sample 2.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the sample, which is 4, with a mention of Gleason 3 being almost equally prominent.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia. In this case, it's false, as the sample shows adenocarcinoma.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field indicates whether perineural invasion is present in the sample. Since it's not mentioned in the report, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `atypia`: This field indicates whether atypia is present in the sample. Since it's not mentioned in the report, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
