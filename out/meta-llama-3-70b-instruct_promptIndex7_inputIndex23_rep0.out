Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": [
    {"sample": 1, "size": "8+6mm"},
    {"sample": 2, "size": "10mm"},
    {"sample": 3, "size": "5+5mm"}
  ],
  "Gleason_score": [
    {"sample": 1, "score": 7, "pattern3": 60, "pattern4": 40},
    {"sample": 2, "score": 7, "pattern3": 70, "pattern4": 30},
    {"sample": 3, "score": NA}
  ],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Note:

* `number_of_samples` is 3, as there are three samples mentioned in the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight` is an array of objects, each containing the sample number and its corresponding size or weight.
* `Gleason_score` is an array of objects, each containing the sample number, Gleason score, and the percentage of pattern 3 and pattern 4. For sample 3, the Gleason score is NA, as it is not mentioned in the report.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only` is false, as the report mentions adenocarcinoma.
* `perineural_invasion` is NA, as it is not mentioned in the report.
* `atypia` is true, as the report mentions PIN-muutoksia (PIN changes), which are a type of atypia.
