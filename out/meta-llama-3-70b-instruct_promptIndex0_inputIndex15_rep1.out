Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```

  "b. Näytteiden koko": NA,
  "c. Gleason-luokitus": NA,
  "d. Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu": kyllä,
  "e. Perineuraalinen kasvu": NA,
  "f. Atypia": ei
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

a. The number of samples taken is 6, as stated in the report.

b. The size of the samples is not mentioned in the report, so the answer is NA.

c. The Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so the answer is NA.

d. The report mentions that benign prostate tissue is seen, which implies that there is no malignant growth, but rather a benign proliferation, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).

e. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is NA.

f. The report explicitly states that no significant atypia is seen, so the answer is "ei" (no).
