Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "19g",
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary_pattern": 5,
    "secondary_pattern": 4
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: Since there is no explicit mention of multiple samples, I assume there is only one sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions the total weight of the prostate tissue as approximately 19g, and 10g was sent for histology.
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions that the Gleason score has a primary pattern of 5 and a secondary pattern of 4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report describes malignant growth, so this field is set to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report mentions "pahanlaatuista kasvua stroomassa", which suggests perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I return NA (Not Available) for this field.
