Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "kyll√§",
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Note: Since the original text does not mention Gleason score, perineural invasion, or atypia, I have marked them as NA (Not Available).
