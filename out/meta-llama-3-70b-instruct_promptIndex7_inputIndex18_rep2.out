Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4+6+3 mm (left) and 5+7+8 mm (right)",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 6, because there are 6 samples mentioned in the report (4+6+3 on the left and 5+7+8 on the right).
* "sample_size_or_weight": The sizes of the samples are provided, but it's not clear which size corresponds to which sample, so I've kept the original text.
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the Gleason score is not mentioned in the report.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions "maligniin viittaavaa kasvua" (malignant growth) and "vahva adenokarsinooma-suspisio" (strong suspicion of adenocarcinoma), indicating that the growth is not benign.
* "perineural_invasion" and "atypia": NA, because these are not mentioned in the report.
