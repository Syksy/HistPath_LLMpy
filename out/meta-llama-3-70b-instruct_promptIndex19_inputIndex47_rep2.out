Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 4,
  "2. Size of samples": "10 mm, 7 mm, 15 mm, 10 mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7/7",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "yes",
  "6. Atypia detection": "kyllä"
}
```

Note: 

* "kyllä" means "yes" in Finnish, and "ei" means "no".
* The Gleason score is reported as major+minor=sum/sum, where major and minor refer to the most common and second most common growth types, respectively.
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not explicitly mentioned in the text, so it is assumed to be not detected.
* Atypia is implied by the presence of low-differentiated carcinoma cells, so it is assumed to be detected.
