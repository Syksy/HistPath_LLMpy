Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 3, because the text mentions that the samples were launched into three tissue cassettes.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "4g", because the text mentions that a total of 4g of planing chips were taken.
