```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": 13,
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "180mm",

  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "NA"

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples is 13, as stated in the report.
2. The size of the samples is 180mm, as stated in the report.
3. The Gleason score is 3+4, as implied by the report, which mentions that "a larger proportion of the separate gland-forming class than class 3 and a smaller proportion of 4 (the latter accounted for about 30% of the tumor found)".
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia (hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu) in the report, so the answer is "ei".
5. There is no mention of perineural growth (perineuraalinen kasvu) in the report, so the answer is "NA".
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "NA".
