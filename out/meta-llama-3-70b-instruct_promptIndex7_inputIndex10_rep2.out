Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 14, // A-D, E-F, G-N, N-O
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 4,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 14, because there are 14 samples mentioned in the report (A-D, E-F, G-N, N-O).
* "sample_size_or_weight": NA, because the report does not mention the size or weight of the samples.
* "Gleason_score": 4, because the report mentions that the dominant Gleason score is 4.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions that there is cancerous growth (Gleason score 4) and not just benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": true, because the report mentions that perineural invasion is present.
* "atypia": NA, because the report does not mention atypia.
