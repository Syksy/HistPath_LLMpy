Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["10mm", "8mm", "14mm", "14mm"],
  "Gleason_score": {"primary": 3, "secondary": 4},
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: There are 4 samples taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the samples are 10mm, 8mm, 14mm, and 14mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is 3 (primary) and 4 (secondary), with a ratio of approximately 90%:10%.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This is false, as there is adenocarcinoma present in sample 4.
* `perineural_invasion`: This is false, as there is no perineural invasion seen in any of the samples.
