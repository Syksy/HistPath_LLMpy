Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 13,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "180mm",
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary": 3,
    "secondary": 4,
    "percentage_secondary": 30
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of biopsy samples taken from the patient, which is 13 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the biopsy material, which is approximately 180mm in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is a grading system used to evaluate the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. In this case, the primary score is 3 and the secondary score is 4, with the secondary score making up approximately 30% of the tumor.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., non-cancerous growth) of the prostate. In this case, the answer is false, since cancer was detected in five of the biopsy samples.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These fields indicate whether perineural invasion (i.e., cancerous growth around nerves) and atypia (i.e., abnormal cell changes) were detected in the sample, respectively. Since these features are not mentioned in the original report, the value for both fields is NA (not available).
