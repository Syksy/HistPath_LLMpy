Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150 mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "kyll√§",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Note: Since the original text does not mention Gleason score, I have marked it as NA (Not Available).
