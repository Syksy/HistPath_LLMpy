Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "120mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": true,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of biopsy samples taken from the patient, which is 6 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total length of the biopsy samples, which is approximately 120mm.
* `Gleason_score`: Since the Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, it is marked as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia`: This field is set to true because the report mentions "basaalisoluhyperplasiaa" (basal cell hyperplasia), which is a benign condition.
* `perineural_invasion`: Since there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, it is marked as NA.
* `atypia`: Similarly, there is no mention of atypia in the report, so it is marked as NA.
