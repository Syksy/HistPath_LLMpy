Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 12,
  "2. Size of samples": "noin 150mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyllä",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Note: 

* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is mentioned as "hyperplastisen kaltaista epiteeliä", which suggests that it can be detected, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
* There is no mention of perineural growth or atypia in the text, so the answers are "ei" (no) for both.
