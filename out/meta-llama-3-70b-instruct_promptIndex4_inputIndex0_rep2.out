Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "100mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient. In this case, it's 1.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample. In this case, it's 100mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions "suspekti maligni" which suggests that the sample is not only benign hyperplasia, so this field is set to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly mentions "perineuraalia kasvua", which indicates perineural invasion, so this field is set to true.
* `atypia`: The report does not mention atypia, so this field is set to false.
