Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "100mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: The report mentions a single sample, so the count is 1.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions a total length of 100mm, which is assumed to be the size of the sample.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so it is marked as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions suspicion of malignancy, so it is not considered benign hyperplasia only.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report explicitly mentions perineural growth, which is a type of perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so it is marked as false.
