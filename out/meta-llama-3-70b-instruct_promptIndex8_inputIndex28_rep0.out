Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": "4+3=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: 6, since there are 6 biopsy samples mentioned in the report.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, since the report does not provide information about the size or weight of the samples.
* `Gleason_score`: "4+3=7", which is the Gleason score mentioned in the report.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: "ei", since the report mentions Gleason 4+3=7 and Gleason 5, indicating that the samples are not only benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: NA, since the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: NA, since the report does not mention atypia.
