Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: Although the text doesn't explicitly state the number of samples, it mentions "sample 1B" and "other samples", implying that there is at least one sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total length of the samples is approximately 150mm.
* `Gleason_score`: Not mentioned in the report, so NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor, so this is false.
* `perineural_invasion`: Not mentioned in the report, so NA.
* `atypia`: The report mentions "nuclear atypia", which corresponds to this field.
