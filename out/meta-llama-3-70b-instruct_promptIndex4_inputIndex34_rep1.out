Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions "Prostate biopsies" and "sample 1B", so I assume there is only one sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions "total length approx. 150mm", so I assume this is the size of the sample.
* `Gleason_score`: The report does not mention a Gleason score, so I return NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions "adenocarcinoma", which is a type of cancer, so I assume it's not just benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report does not mention perineural invasion, so I return NA.
* `atypia`: The report mentions "nuclear atypia", which is a type of atypia, so I return true.
