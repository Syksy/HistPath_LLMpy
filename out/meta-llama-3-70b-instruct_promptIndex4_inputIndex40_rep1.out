Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 14,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": {
    "primary": 4,
    "secondary": 3
  },
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: 14 samples were taken from the patient (A-N).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: No information about the size or weight of the samples is provided, so NA is returned.
* `Gleason_score`: The prevailing Gleason class is 4, and there is also some class 3, so both are reported.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions a tumor infiltrating through the capsule into the fat, so it's not just benign hyperplasia, hence false.
* `perineural_invasion`: Perineural invasion is abundantly observed, so true.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so NA is returned.
