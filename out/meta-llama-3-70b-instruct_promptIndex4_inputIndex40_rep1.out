Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 14,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 4,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: 14 samples were taken from the patient (A-D, E-F, G-N, and N-O).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: No information is provided about the size or weight of the samples, so NA is returned.
* `Gleason_score`: The prevailing Gleason class is 4, with some class 3 also present.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions a tumor and perineural invasion, so this is not a case of benign hyperplasia only.
* `perineural_invasion`: Perineural invasion is abundantly observed in the samples.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so NA is returned.
