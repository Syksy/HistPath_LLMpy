Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 13,
  "2. Size of samples": "about 180mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7/7/NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* For question 3, I assumed the Gleason score is 3+4=7 based on the text, but it's not explicitly stated. If this is incorrect, please let me know.
* For questions 4, 5, and 6, I answered "NA" (Not Available) since the text does not mention BPH, perineural growth, or atypia.
