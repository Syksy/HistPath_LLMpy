Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_biopsies": 6,
  "biopsy_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": "4+4=8",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": "kyllä"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of biopsies is 6, as stated in the report.
* The biopsy size or weight is not mentioned in the report, so it is marked as NA.
* The Gleason score is reported as 4+4=8, 4+3=7, and 3+4=7 in different colonies, but I have only included one of them in the structured report. If you want to include all of them, we can modify the report to include an array of Gleason scores.
* The report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor, so benign hyperplasia only is marked as "ei".
* Perineural invasion is not mentioned in the report, so it is marked as NA.
* Atypia is mentioned in the report, so it is marked as "kyllä".
