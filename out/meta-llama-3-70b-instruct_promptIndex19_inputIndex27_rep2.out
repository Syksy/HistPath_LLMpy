Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 12,
  "2. Size of samples": ["8mm", "7mm", "5mm"],
  "3. Gleason score": "3+3",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The text mentions "3/12 biopsiosta", which means 3 out of 12 biopsies showed cancer, so there are 12 samples in total.
2. The sizes of the samples are mentioned as 8mm, 7mm, and 5mm.
3. The Gleason score is mentioned as "Gleason 3 arkkitehtuuri" in multiple places, which corresponds to a Gleason score of 3+3.
4. There is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) in the text, so it's unlikely to be detected.
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so it's not possible to determine if it's present or not.
6. The text explicitly states "Ei havaita tuma-atypiaa", which means no atypia was detected.
