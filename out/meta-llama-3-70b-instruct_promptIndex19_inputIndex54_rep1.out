Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 8,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyllä",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions that the samples have been started in eight blocks, so the number of samples is 8.
2. There is no information about the size of the samples, so the answer is NA (not available).
3. There is no mention of the Gleason score, so the answer is NA.
4. Although the text does not explicitly mention BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia), the finding is described as benign, which suggests that BPH might be present, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
