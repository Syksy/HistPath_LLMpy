Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size": "150mm",
  "gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 1 in this case.
* `sample_size`: The total length of the sample, which is approximately 150mm.
* `gleason_score`: Since the Gleason score is not explicitly mentioned in the report, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia`: The report does not indicate that the sample only shows benign hyperplasia, so I've set this to false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've set this to false.
* `atypia`: The report mentions nuclear atypia in sample 1B, which corresponds to adenocarcinoma, so I've set this to true.

Please note that the Gleason score is not provided in this report, and it's not possible to determine it from the given information.
