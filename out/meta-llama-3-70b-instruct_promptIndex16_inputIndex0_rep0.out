Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "1",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "100mm",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "kyllä",
  "6. Atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The report mentions a single sample, so the answer is 1.
2. The sample is 100mm in length, as mentioned in the report.
3. There is no Gleason score mentioned in the report, so the answer is NA (not available).
4. The report does not mention any benign prostatic hyperplasia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. The report explicitly mentions perineural growth, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "ei" (no).
