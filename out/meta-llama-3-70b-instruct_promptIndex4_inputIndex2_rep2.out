Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "90mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 3 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total length of the samples, which is 90mm.
* `Gleason_score`: Since the Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, the value is set to NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field is set to true, indicating that the report suggests only benign hyperplasia, with no signs of malignancy.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field is set to false, as there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: This field is set to false, as the report explicitly states that there is no atypia or malignant findings.
