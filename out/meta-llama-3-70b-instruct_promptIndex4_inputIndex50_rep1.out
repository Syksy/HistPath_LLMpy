Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_biopsies": 6,
  "biopsy_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": [
    {"colony": 1, "score": 8, "grade3": 0, "grade4": 4},
    {"colony": 2, "score": 7, "grade3": 3, "grade4": 4},
    {"colony": 3, "score": 7, "grade3": 3, "grade4": 4}
  ],
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia_present": true
}
```

Note: 

* `biopsy_size_or_weight` is marked as NA since the original text does not provide this information.
* `perineural_invasion` is marked as NA since the original text does not mention it.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only` is set to false since the report mentions adenocarcinoma and Gleason scores.
* `atypia_present` is set to true since the report mentions atypical glandular structure.
