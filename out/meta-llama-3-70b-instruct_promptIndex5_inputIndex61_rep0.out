I'll do my best to extract the relevant information from the given text and convert it into a structured format in JSON.

Here is the parsed output:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

The reason for all the `NA` values is that the provided text does not contain any relevant information about the histopathological sample. The text appears to be a nonsensical sequence of words and numbers, and does not match any of the three types of histopathological reports you mentioned.

If you could provide a real histopathological report, I would be happy to help you extract the relevant information and convert it into a structured format in JSON.
