Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": ("3"),
  "2. Size of samples": ("90mm"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("NA"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("kyll√§"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("ei")
}
```

Note: The Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so I marked it as "NA" (not available).
