Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "5g",
  "Gleason_score": 8,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 1 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample, which is 5g in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the sample, which is 8 in this case.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: A boolean indicating whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia, which is false in this case since adenocarcinoma is present.
* `perineural_invasion`: The presence of perineural invasion, which is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
* `atypia`: The presence of atypia, which is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as NA (Not Available).
