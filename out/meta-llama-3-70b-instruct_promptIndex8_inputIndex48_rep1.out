Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4+6+3mm, 5+7+8mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 6, because there are 6 biopsy needle samples mentioned in the report (3 from the left and 3 from the right).
* "sample_size_or_weight": "4+6+3mm, 5+7+8mm", because the report mentions the length of the samples in millimeters.
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention the Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA, because the report does not explicitly state whether the growth is benign or not.
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": NA, because the report does not mention atypia.
