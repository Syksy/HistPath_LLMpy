Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "8mm, 7mm, 5mm",
  "Gleason_score": "3+3",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: 12 biopsies were taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the biopsies are 8mm, 7mm, and 5mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is 3+3.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The answer is "ei" (no) because the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor.
* `perineural_invasion`: The answer is "ei" (no) because there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: The answer is "ei" (no) because the report explicitly states that no atypia was found.
