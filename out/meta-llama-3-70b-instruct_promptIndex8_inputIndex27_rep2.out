Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "8mm, 7mm, 5mm",
  "Gleason_score": "3+3",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Let me explain how I arrived at this structured report:

* `sample_count`: The text mentions 12 biopsies in total.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The text mentions the sizes of three biopsies: 8mm, 7mm, and 5mm. I combined these into a single string.
* `Gleason_score`: The text mentions Gleason 3 architecture in multiple biopsies, and the summary mentions a score of 3+3.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The text mentions cancer findings in some biopsies, so this is set to "ei" (no).
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the text, so this is set to NA.
* `atypia`: The text explicitly states that there is no tumor atypia, so this is set to "ei" (no).
