Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_biopsies": 6,
  "biopsy_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": [
    {"location": "Colony 1", "score": "4+4=8"},
    {"location": "Colony 2", "score": "4+3=7"},
    {"location": "Colony 3", "score": "3+4=7"}
  ],
  "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia": true,
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": true
}
```

Note: 

* "number_of_biopsies" is 6, as stated in the report.
* "biopsy_size_or_weight" is "NA" since the report does not provide this information.
* "Gleason_score" is an array of objects, each representing a Gleason score found in a different colony.
* "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia" is true, as the report mentions "hyperplastic changes in the epithelium" in some samples.
* "perineural_invasion" is "NA" since the report does not mention it.
* "atypia" is true, as the report mentions "atypical glandular structure" in Colony 1.
