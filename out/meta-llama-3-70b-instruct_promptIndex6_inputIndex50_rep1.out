Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_biopsies": 6,
  "biopsy_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": [
    {"location": "Colony 1", "score": "4+4=8"},
    {"location": "Colony 2", "score": "4+3=7"},
    {"location": "Colony 3", "score": "3+4=7"}
  ],
  "benign_prostatic_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia_present": true
}
```

Note: I assumed that the presence of adenocarcinoma and atypical glandular structure indicates that the sample is not only benign prostatic hyperplasia. If this assumption is incorrect, please let me know and I'll correct the response.
