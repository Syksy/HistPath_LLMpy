Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "10g",
  "3. Gleason score": "5+4=/9/",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyll√§",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. Only one sample is mentioned in the text, which is approximately 19g in total, with 10g sent for histology.
2. The size of the sample sent for histology is 10g.
3. The Gleason score is reported as having mostly grade 5 and secondarily grade 4, which corresponds to a Gleason score of 5+4=9.
4. The presence of "fibromuskulaaria stroomaa" suggests that BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) can be detected in the samples.
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so it is marked as NA (not available).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so it is marked as NA (not available).
