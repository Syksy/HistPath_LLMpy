Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 9, 
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA, 
  "Gleason_score": 3+4, 
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, 
  "perineural_invasion": NA, 
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 9, because there are 9 samples mentioned in the report (A-C, D-E, F-G, H-I).
* "sample_size_or_weight": NA, because the report does not mention the size or weight of the samples.
* "Gleason_score": 3+4, because the report mentions that the dominant Gleason score is 3 and there is also a significant amount of Gleason score 4.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions a large tumor and positive margins, indicating that it is not just benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": NA, because the report does not mention atypia.
