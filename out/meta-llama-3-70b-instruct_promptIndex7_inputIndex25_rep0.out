Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 4,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 4, because the report mentions "NÃ¤ytteet 1-4" which implies that there are 4 samples.
* "sample_size_or_weight": NA, because the report only mentions the size of the cancerous area in sample 2, but not the size or weight of the samples themselves.
* "Gleason_score": 4, because the report states that the dominant Gleason score is 4, although Gleason score 3 is also present.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA, because the report does not explicitly state that the sample only shows benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": NA, because the report does not mention atypia.
