Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30mm",
  "Gleason_score": 7,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of biopsy samples taken from the patient, which is 3 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total length of the biopsy samples, which is 30mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the cancerous tissue, which is 7 (3+4).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia (i.e., no cancer). In this case, it's false because cancerous tissue was found.
* `perineural_invasion`: This field indicates whether perineural invasion (i.e., cancerous growth around nerves) was observed. In this case, it's false because there's no mention of it in the report.
* `atypia`: This field indicates whether atypical changes (i.e., abnormal cell growth) were observed. In this case, it's false because there's no mention of it in the report.

Note that some fields may have NA (Not Available) values if the corresponding information is not present in the report.
