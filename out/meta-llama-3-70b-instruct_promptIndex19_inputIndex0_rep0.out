Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "100mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "yes",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions "n√§yte" which is a singular form, indicating that only one sample has been taken.
2. The size of the sample is 100mm, as mentioned in the text.
3. There is no mention of the Gleason score in the text, so it's marked as NA (not available).
4. There is no indication of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) in the text, so it's marked as "ei" (no).
5. The text explicitly mentions "perineuraalia kasvua" which means perineural growth, so it's marked as "yes".
6. The text does not mention atypia or PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia), so it's marked as "ei" (no).
