Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 12,
  "2. Size of samples": ["8mm", "7mm", "5mm"],
  "3. Gleason score": "3+3",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Note: 

* "ei" means "no" in Finnish.
* "NA" means "not available" or "not applicable".
* The Gleason score is reported as "3+3" which means the primary pattern is 3 and the secondary pattern is also 3.
* BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not mentioned in the report, so it's assumed to be not detected.
* Perineural growth is not mentioned in the report, so it's marked as "NA".
* Atypia is explicitly mentioned as not detected ("Ei havaita tuma-atypiaa").
