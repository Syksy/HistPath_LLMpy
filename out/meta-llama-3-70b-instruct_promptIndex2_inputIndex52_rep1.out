Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("9-11"),
  "2. Size of the samples": ("macrosections, not specified"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("3+4=7"),
  "4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia": ("ei"),
  "5. Perineural growth": ("ei"),
  "6. Atypia": ("NA")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The number of samples taken is not explicitly stated, but based on the text, it appears that there are 9-11 samples taken (Apex to samples A-C, two macrosections per base D-E, F-G base and H-I two samples from seminal vesicles).
2. The size of the samples is not specified, but it is mentioned that they are macrosections.
3. The Gleason score is 3+4=7, based on the text stating that "the prevailing Gleason grade 3 and grade 4 differentiation is almost equal".
4. There is no mention of benign prostatic hyperplasia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth, so the answer is "ei" (no).
6. There is no mention of atypia, so the answer is "NA" (not applicable).
