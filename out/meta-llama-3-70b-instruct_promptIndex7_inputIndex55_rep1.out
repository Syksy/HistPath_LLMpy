Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 4,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": 4,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions "Samples 1-4", so there are 4 samples.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: There is no information about the size or weight of the samples, so the value is NA.
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions that the most prevalent Gleason grade is 4, although grade 3 is also present.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor, so this value is false.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: There is no information about these features in the report, so the values are NA.
