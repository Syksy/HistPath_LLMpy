Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 3,
  "2. Size of samples": "4g",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyllä",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions that the samples were launched into three tissue cassettes, implying that there are 3 samples.
2. The size of the samples is 4g.
3. There is no mention of the Gleason score in the text, so it's NA (not available).
4. The text suggests subtly prostatic hyperplasia, which is a synonym for BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia), so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so it's NA (not available).
6. There is no mention of atypia in the text, so it's NA (not available).
