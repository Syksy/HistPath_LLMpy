Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": "4+3=7",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: 6, as there are 6 biopsy samples mentioned (1 base right, 2 center right, ..., 6 apex left).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: NA, as no information about the size or weight of the samples is provided.
* `Gleason_score`: "4+3=7", as the Gleason score is explicitly mentioned in the report.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: false, as the report mentions Gleason 5 growth patterns and poorly differentiated Gleason 4+3=7 growth, indicating malignant changes.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: NA, as there is no mention of these features in the report.
