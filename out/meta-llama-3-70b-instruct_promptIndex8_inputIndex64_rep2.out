It seems like there's a syntax error in the SQL query, and the required parameters are not found. In this case, I'll return a JSON-formatted response with NA values for all the requested fields.

Here's the response:

```
{
  "sample_count": "NA",
  "sample_amount": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA",
  "patient_bph": "NA",
  "sample_perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "sample_atypia": "NA"
}
```

Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
