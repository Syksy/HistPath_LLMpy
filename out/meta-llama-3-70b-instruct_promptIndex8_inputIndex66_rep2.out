What a beautiful poem! However, I must inform you that it doesn't contain any histopathological information. It appears to be a heartfelt and emotional poem about loss and grief.

As a result, I will return a JSON object with all values set to "NA", indicating that the information is not available in the provided text.

Here is the JSON object:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": "NA",
  "sample_size_or_weight": "NA",
  "Gleason_score": "NA",
  "benign_hyperplasia": "NA",
  "perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

If you could provide a histopathological report in a free-text format, I would be happy to help you convert it into a structured format.
