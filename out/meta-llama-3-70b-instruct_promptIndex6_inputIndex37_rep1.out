Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "approx. 120mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": NA,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions 6 representative prostate biopsies, so this field is populated with the value 6.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions the total size of the samples as approximately 120mm, so this field is populated with this value.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so this field is marked as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions basal cell hyperplasia, but it's not clear if it's only benign hyperplasia, so this field is marked as NA.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so this field is marked as NA.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so this field is marked as NA.

Please note that some fields are marked as NA because the information is not available in the provided report.
