Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "4g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 3 in this case, as the planing chips were launched into three tissue cassettes.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The total weight of the samples, which is 4g.
* `Gleason_score`: Since the report does not mention a Gleason score, I have marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report suggests subtly prostatic hyperplasia, which is a benign condition, so I have marked this as true.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I have marked this as false.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so I have marked this as false.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to clarify any of the fields!
