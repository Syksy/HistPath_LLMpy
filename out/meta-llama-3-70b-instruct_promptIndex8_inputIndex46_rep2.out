Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "8mm, 5mm",
  "Gleason_score": "4+4, 3+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "ei",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "NA"
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient is 6 (macrosections).
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the foci of the malignant samples are approximately 8mm and 5mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason scores are 4+4 and 3+4.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: Since adenocarcinoma is found, this is not a case of benign hyperplasia only, so the answer is "ei" (no).
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion, so the answer is "ei" (no).
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia, so the answer is "NA" (not available).
