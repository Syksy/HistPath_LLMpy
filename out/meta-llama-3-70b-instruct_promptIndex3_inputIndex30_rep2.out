Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 1,
  "2. Size of samples": "100mm",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "NA",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "yes",
  "6. Atypia detection": "no"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is assumed to be 1 since the text mentions "A representative sample".
* The size of the sample is mentioned as 100mm.
* The Gleason score is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as "NA".
* There is no mention of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) or atypia in the text, so they are marked as "NA" and "no" respectively.
* Perineural growth is mentioned as suspicious for malignancy, so it's marked as "yes".
