I'm happy to help! However, I have to inform you that the provided text is not a histopathological report, but rather an error message from a SQL query. It does not contain any information about a patient's sample or diagnosis.

Therefore, I will return an object with all values set to 'NA', as there is no relevant information to extract.

Here is the response in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": "NA",
  "sample_amount": "NA",
  "gleason_grade": "NA",
  "patient_bph": "NA",
  "sample_perineural_invasion": "NA",
  "sample_atypia": "NA"
}
```

If you could provide the actual histopathological report, I would be happy to assist you in extracting the required information.
