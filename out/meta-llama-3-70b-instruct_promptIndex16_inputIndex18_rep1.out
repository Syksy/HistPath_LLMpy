Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "(4+6+3)+(5+7+8) = 13",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "4mm, 6mm, 3mm, 5mm, 7mm, 8mm",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "NA"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 13, as there are 4+6+3=13 samples from the left side and 5+7+8=20 samples from the right side, but due to the indexing error, the left and right sides are swapped.
* The sizes of the samples are 4mm, 6mm, 3mm, 5mm, 7mm, and 8mm.
* There is no Gleason score mentioned in the report, so it is marked as NA (Not Available).
* There is no evidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in the report, so it is marked as "ei" (no).
* There is no mention of perineural invasion or atypia in the report, so they are marked as NA (Not Available).
