Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "30g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: NA, because the report does not mention the number of samples taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: "30g", because the report mentions that about 30g of planing chips were received.
* `Gleason_score`: NA, because the report does not mention a Gleason score.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: true, because the report concludes that the finding is suitable for suspected benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: false, because there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: false, because the report explicitly states that no atypia is visible.
