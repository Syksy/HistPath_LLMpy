Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "20g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 6, because the report mentions "six blocks" of tissue.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "20g", because the report mentions "about 20g" of tissue in six blocks.
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention a Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": true, because the report concludes with "suspected benign hyperplasia" and does not mention any malignancy.
* "perineural_invasion": false, because the report does not mention any perineural invasion.
* "atypia": false, because the report explicitly states "no atypia".
