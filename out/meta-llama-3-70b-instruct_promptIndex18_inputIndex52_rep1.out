Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 9,
  "2. Size of samples": "NA",
  "3. Gleason score": "3+4=7/7/NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "ei",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "ei",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Note: 

* The number of samples is 9 because there are 3 samples from the apex (A-C), 4 macrosections from the base (D-E, F-G), and 2 samples from the seminal vesicles (H-I).
* The size of samples is not mentioned in the text, so it's marked as "NA" (Not Available).
* The Gleason score is 3+4=7, which is calculated based on the prevailing Gleason grade 3 and grade 4 differentiation.
* BPH, perineural growth, and atypia are not mentioned in the text, so they are marked as "ei" (no in Finnish).
