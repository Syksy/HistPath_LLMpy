Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": NA,
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 6, because the report mentions "Näytteenä 1-6 prostatabiopsiat tyyppipaikoista", indicating that 6 biopsy samples were taken.
* "sample_size_or_weight": NA, because the report does not provide information about the size or weight of the samples.
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention the Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": true, because the report states that the samples show benign prostate tissue and no carcinoma or PIN changes were found.
* "perineural_invasion": false, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": false, because the report states that no significant atypia was found in the epithelial cells.
