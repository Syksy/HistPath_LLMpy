Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 1 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample, which is approximately 150mm in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score is not mentioned in the report, so it is marked as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions a focus with tumor-atypia and morphological findings suggestive of adenocarcinoma, but it is not clear if it's only benign hyperplasia, so this field is marked as false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so it is marked as NA.
* `atypia`: The report mentions tumor-atypia, so this field is marked as true.

Please note that some fields may be marked as NA if the information is not available in the report.
