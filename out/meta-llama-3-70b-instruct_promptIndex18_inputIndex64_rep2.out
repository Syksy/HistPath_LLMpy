I apologize, but the provided text is not a medical note written by a pathologist in Finnish. It appears to be an error message related to a SQL query.

As a result, I cannot extract the requested information from the text. The answers to the questions would be:

{
"1. Number of samples": NA,
"2. Size of samples": NA,
"3. Gleason score": NA,
"4. BPH detection": NA,
"5. Perineural growth detection": NA,
"6. Atypia detection": NA
}

If you could provide the actual medical note in Finnish, I would be happy to assist you in extracting the requested information.
