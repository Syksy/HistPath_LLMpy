Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 13,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "180mm",
  "Gleason_score": "3+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 13, because the report mentions 13 biopsies.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "180mm", because the report mentions the material is approximately 180mm.
* "Gleason_score": "3+4", because the report mentions the Gleason score is 3 with a smaller component of 4 (approximately 30%).
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions carcinoma in five biopsies.
* "perineural_invasion" and "atypia": NA, because the report does not mention these specific features.
