Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Explanation:

* "number_of_samples": 1, because the report mentions "Näytteesssä 1B" which suggests that there is only one sample.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm", because the report mentions "kokonaispituus n. 150mm".
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention the Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": false, because the report mentions "tuma-atypiaa" and "morfologinen löydös vastaisi adenokarsinoomaa", which suggests that the sample is not only benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": NA, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": true, because the report mentions "tuma-atypiaa".
