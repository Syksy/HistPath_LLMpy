Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions multiple samples, but it's not clear how many, so I assumed 1.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions a total length of 150mm, which I interpreted as the sample size or weight.
* `Gleason_score`: There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so I returned NA.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions adenocarcinoma-like morphology, so it's not just benign hyperplasia, hence false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There is no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I returned NA.
* `atypia`: The report mentions tumour-atypia, which I interpreted as atypia, hence true.
