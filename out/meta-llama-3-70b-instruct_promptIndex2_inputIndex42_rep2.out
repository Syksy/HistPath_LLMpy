Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("12"),
  "2. Size of the samples taken": ("NA"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("3+4=7"),
  "4. Is there benign prostatic hyperplasia in the sample?": ("ei"),
  "5. Is there perineural growth in the sample?": ("NA"),
  "6. Is there atypia in the sample?": ("NA")
}
```

Note: 

* For question 2, the size of the samples taken is not specified in the report, so I answered "NA" (not available).
* For question 4, the report does not mention benign prostatic hyperplasia, so I answered "ei" (no).
* For questions 5 and 6, the report does not mention perineural growth or atypia, so I answered "NA" (not available) for both.
