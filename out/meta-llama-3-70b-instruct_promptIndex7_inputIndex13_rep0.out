Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "19g",
  "Gleason_score": "5+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": true,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: Only one sample is mentioned in the report, so the answer is 1.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions that the total weight of the prostate tissue is approximately 19g, and 10g was sent for histology.
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions that the Gleason score is mostly composed of grade 5 and secondarily grade 4, so the answer is "5+4".
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions "pahanlaatuista kasvua" which means malignant growth, so it's not just benign hyperplasia. Therefore, the answer is false.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report mentions "mattomaista pahanlaatuista kasvua stroomassa" which suggests perineural invasion, so the answer is true.
* `atypia`: There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is NA (not available).
