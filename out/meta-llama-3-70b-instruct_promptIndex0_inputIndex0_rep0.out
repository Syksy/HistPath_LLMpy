Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "a. Näytteiden määrä": "NA",
  "b. Näytteiden koko": "100mm",
  "c. Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "d. Eturauhasen hyvälaatuinen liikakasvu": "ei",
  "e. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "kyllä",
  "f. Atypia": "NA"
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

a. The number of samples taken is not explicitly mentioned in the report, so the answer is "NA".

b. The report mentions that the sample is 100mm in length, so that's the answer.

c. There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so the answer is "NA".

d. The report does not mention benign prostatic hyperplasia, so the answer is "ei" (no).

e. The report explicitly mentions perineural growth, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).

f. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is "NA".
