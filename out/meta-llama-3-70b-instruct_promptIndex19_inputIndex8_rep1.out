Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 6,
  "2. Size of samples": "noin 30g",
  "3. Gleason score": "NA",
  "4. BPH detection": "kyllä",
  "5. Perineural growth detection": "NA",
  "6. Atypia detection": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

1. The text mentions that the samples were divided into six blocks, so the number of samples is 6.
2. The size of the samples is approximately 30g.
3. There is no mention of the Gleason score in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
4. The text mentions "hyvänlaatuiseen hyperplasiaan", which is Finnish for "benign hyperplasia", which is another term for BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia). So, the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the text, so the answer is NA (not available).
6. The text explicitly states that there is no atypia, so the answer is "ei" (no).
