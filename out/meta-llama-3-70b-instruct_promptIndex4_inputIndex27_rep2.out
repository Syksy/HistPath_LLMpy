Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 12,
  "sample_size_or_weight": ["8mm", "7mm", "5mm"],
  "Gleason_score": 3,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: The number of biopsies taken from the patient, which is 12.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The sizes of the biopsies, which are 8mm, 7mm, and 5mm.
* `Gleason_score`: The Gleason score of the cancerous tissue, which is 3.
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This is false because the report mentions adenocarcinoma, which is a malignant tumor.
* `perineural_invasion`: This is NA (not available) because there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report.
* `atypia`: This is false because the report explicitly states that there is no atypia.
