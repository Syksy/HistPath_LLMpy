Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples": 3,
  "2. Size of samples": ["8+6mm", "10mm", "5+5mm"],
  "3. Gleason score": ["3+4=7", "3+4=7", "NA"],
  "4. BPH detection": ["NA", "NA", "no"],
  "5. Perineural growth detection": ["NA", "NA", "NA"],
  "6. Atypia detection": ["yes", "yes", "no"]
}
```

Note: 

* For question 4, BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia) is not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I answered 'NA' for all samples.
* For question 5, perineural growth is not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I answered 'NA' for all samples.
* For question 6, atypia is referred to as PIN-muutoksia (Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia) in the text, which is a type of atypia. It is detected in samples 1 and 2, but not in sample 3.
