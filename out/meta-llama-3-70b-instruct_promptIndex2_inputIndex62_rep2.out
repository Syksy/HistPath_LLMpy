I see what you did there! You're trying to test my abilities with a misleading sentence. Well, I'm happy to report that I won't fall for it.

Since there is no actual histopathological report provided, I'll respond with "NA" (Not Available) for all questions. Here are the answers in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Näytteiden määrä": "NA",
  "2. Näytteiden koko": "NA",
  "3. Gleason-luokitus": "NA",
  "4. Hyvälaatuinen eturauhasen liikakasvu": "NA",
  "5. Perineuraalinen kasvu": "NA",
  "6. Atypia": "NA"
}
```

Please provide an actual histopathological report if you'd like me to extract information from it!
