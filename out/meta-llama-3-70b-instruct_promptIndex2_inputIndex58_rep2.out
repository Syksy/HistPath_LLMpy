Here are the answers to the questions in JSON format:

```
{
  "1. Number of samples taken": ("6"),
  "2. Size of the samples": ("NA"),
  "3. Gleason score": ("4+3=7"),
  "4. Presence of well-differentiated prostate cancer": ("ei"),
  "5. Presence of perineural growth": ("NA"),
  "6. Presence of atypia": ("NA")
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each answer:

1. The patient has 6 biopsy samples taken, as indicated by the numbers 1-6 in the report.
2. The size of the samples is not specified in the report, so I've marked it as "NA" (not available).
3. The Gleason score is reported as 4+3=7, which indicates poorly differentiated prostate cancer.
4. Since the report mentions poorly differentiated Gleason 4+3=7 growth, it implies that there is no well-differentiated prostate cancer present, so I've marked it as "ei" (no).
5. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so I've marked it as "NA" (not available).
6. Similarly, there is no mention of atypia in the report, so I've marked it as "NA" (not available).
