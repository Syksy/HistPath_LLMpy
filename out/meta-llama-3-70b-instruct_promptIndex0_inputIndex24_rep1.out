Explanation:

* b. There is no information about the size of the samples, so the answer is NA.
* c. There is no mention of Gleason score in the report, so the answer is NA.
* d. The report states that the finding is benign, which implies that there is no malignant growth, but rather a benign growth, so the answer is "kyllä" (yes).
* e. There is no mention of perineural growth in the report, so the answer is NA.
* f. There is no mention of atypia in the report, so the answer is NA.
