  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "12.3g",
  "gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": "kyll√§",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: Not mentioned in the report, so NA.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: Mentioned as 12.3g.
* `gleason_score`: Not mentioned in the report, so NA.
