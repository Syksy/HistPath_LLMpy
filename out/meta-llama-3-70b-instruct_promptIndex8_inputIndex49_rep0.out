Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": NA,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "12.3g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia": "kyllä",
  "perineural_invasion": "ei",
  "atypia": "ei"
}
```

Explanation:

* `sample_count`: NA, because the report doesn't explicitly mention the number of samples taken from the patient.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: "12.3g", because the report mentions the total weight of the chips.
* `Gleason_score`: NA, because the report doesn't mention the Gleason score.
* `benign_hyperplasia`: "kyllä", because the report mentions stromal hyperplasia, which is a type of benign hyperplasia.
* `perineural_invasion`: "ei", because the report doesn't mention any perineural invasion.
* `atypia`: "ei", because the report doesn't mention any atypia or abnormal changes in the tissue.
