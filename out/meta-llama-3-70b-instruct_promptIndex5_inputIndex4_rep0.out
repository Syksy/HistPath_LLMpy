Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the output:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "150mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": true
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `sample_count`: The number of samples taken from the patient, which is 1 in this case.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The size or weight of the sample, which is approximately 150mm in this case.
* `Gleason_score`: Since the Gleason score is not explicitly mentioned in the report, I've marked it as NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: This field indicates whether the sample only shows benign hyperplasia. In this case, since there's a suspicion of adenocarcinoma, I've marked it as false.
* `perineural_invasion`: There's no mention of perineural invasion in the report, so I've marked it as NA.
* `atypia`: The report mentions "tuma-atypiaa" which suggests atypical changes in the tissue, so I've marked it as true.

Please note that some fields may be marked as NA if the information is not available in the report.
