Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "sample_count": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "12.3g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* "sample_count": 1, because the report mentions a single sample.
* "sample_size_or_weight": "12.3g", which is the weight of the sample.
* "Gleason_score": NA, because the report does not mention a Gleason score.
* "benign_hyperplasia_only": true, because the report mentions "strooman hyperplasiasta" which suggests benign hyperplasia.
* "perineural_invasion": false, because the report does not mention perineural invasion.
* "atypia": false, because the report does not mention any atypical changes.
