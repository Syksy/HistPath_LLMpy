Based on the provided histopathological report, I will convert it into a structured format in JSON. Here is the response:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 6,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "20g",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: The report mentions that about 20g of tissue were divided into six blocks, so I assume there are 6 samples.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions that about 20g of tissue were started in six blocks.
* `Gleason_score`: Since the report does not mention a Gleason score, I return NA (Not Available).
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report concludes that the finding is suitable for suspected benign hyperplasia, so I set this field to true.
* `perineural_invasion`: The report does not mention perineural invasion, so I set this field to false.
* `atypia`: The report explicitly states that no atypia is visible, so I set this field to false.
