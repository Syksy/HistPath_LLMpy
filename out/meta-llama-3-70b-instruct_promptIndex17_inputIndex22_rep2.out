Note: The number of samples taken is inferred from the text, which mentions apex näytteisiin A-C, kaksi makroleikettä kohti basista D-E, F-G basis ja H-I kaksi näytettä seminaalivehikkeleistä, which suggests 9 samples in total. However, the size of the samples is not mentioned in the text. The Gleason score is mentioned as Gleason luokka 3 ja luokan 4, but it's not clear if this is the overall score or if there are multiple scores for different samples. The other questions (4-6) cannot be answered based on the provided text.
