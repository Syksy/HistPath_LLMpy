Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 1,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "19g",
  "Gleason_score": "5+4",
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": false,
  "perineural_invasion": NA,
  "atypia": NA
}
```

Here's a brief explanation for each field:

* `number_of_samples`: Since the report doesn't explicitly mention the number of samples, I assumed it's 1, as it's a single prostate tissue sample.
* `sample_size_or_weight`: The report mentions the total weight of the prostate shavings as 19g, and 10g were sent for histology.
* `Gleason_score`: The report mentions the highest level as 5 and the second highest level as 4 in the Gleason classification, so I combined them as "5+4".
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: The report mentions a "carpet-like malignant growth", which indicates that it's not just benign hyperplasia, so I set this to `false`.
* `perineural_invasion` and `atypia`: These were not mentioned in the report, so I set them to `NA` (Not Available).
