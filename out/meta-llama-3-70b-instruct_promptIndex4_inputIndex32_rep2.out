Here is the structured report in JSON format:

```
{
  "number_of_samples": 3,
  "sample_size_or_weight": "90mm",
  "Gleason_score": NA,
  "benign_hyperplasia_only": true,
  "perineural_invasion": false,
  "atypia": false
}
```

Explanation:

* `number_of_samples`: 3, as mentioned in the report ("Samples of 3 prostatic core needle biopsies")
* `sample_size_or_weight`: "90mm", as mentioned in the report ("The total length of the samples is 90mm")
* `Gleason_score`: NA, as there is no mention of Gleason score in the report
* `benign_hyperplasia_only`: true, as the report suggests hyperplasia ("glandular structures, which would perhaps indicate hyperplasia") and no malignancy
* `perineural_invasion`: false, as there is no mention of perineural invasion in the report
* `atypia`: false, as the report explicitly states that no atypia was found
